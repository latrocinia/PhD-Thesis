	called ribosomes. Although the structures of prokaryotic, yeast and
	protist ribosomes have been determined, the more complex molecular
	architecture of metazoan 80S ribosomes has so far remained elusive.
	Here we present structures of Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens
	80S ribosomes in complex with the translation factor eEF2, E-site
	transfer RNA and Stm1-like proteins, based on high-resolution cryo-electron-microscopy
	density maps. These structures not only illustrate the co-evolution
	of metazoan-specific ribosomal RNA with ribosomal proteins but also
	reveal the presence of two additional structural layers in metazoan
	ribosomes, a well-ordered inner layer covered by a flexible RNA outer
	layer. The human and Drosophila ribosome structures will provide
	the basis for more detailed structural, biochemical and genetic experiments.},

  abstract = {A novel contour-based matching criterion is presented for the quantitative
	docking of high-resolution structures of components into low-resolution
	maps of macromolecular complexes. The proposed Laplacian filter is
	combined with a six-dimensional search using fast Fourier transforms
	to rapidly scan the rigid-body degrees of freedom of a probe molecule
	relative to a fixed target density map. A comparison of the docking
	performance with the standard cross-correlation criterion demonstrates
	that contour matching with the Laplacian filter significantly extends
	the viable resolution range of correlation-based fitting to resolutions
	as low as 30 A. The gain in docking precision at medium to low resolution
	(15-30 A) is critical for image reconstructions from electron microscopy
	(EM). The new algorithm enables for the first time the reliable docking
	of smaller molecular components into EM densities of large biomolecular
	assemblies at such low resolutions. As an example of the practical
	effectiveness of contour-based fitting, a new pseudo-atomic model
	of a microtubule was constructed from a 20 A resolution EM map and
	from atomic structures of alpha and beta tubulin subunits.},

	accelerates the rotation of the Fourier image of the electron density

	of the new method, an algorithm for the rotation of the density in
	the Hermite basis and an algorithm for the conversion of the expansion

	form. To assess the quality of density encoding in the Hermite basis,
	an analytical way of computing the crystallographic R factor is presented.
	Finally, the algorithm is validated using two examples and its efficiency
	is compared with two widely used fitting methods, ADP_EM and colores

	microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps is an important technique for modeling
	the atomic structures of very large macromolecular assemblies. This
	article presents "gEMfitter", a highly parallel fast Fourier transform
	(FFT) EM density fitting program which can exploit the special hardware
	properties of modern graphics processor units (GPUs) to accelerate
	both the translational and rotational parts of the correlation search.
	In particular, by using the GPU's special texture memory hardware
	to rotate 3D voxel grids, the cost of rotating large 3D density maps
	is almost completely eliminated. Compared to performing 3D correlations
	on one core of a contemporary central processor unit (CPU), running
	gEMfitter on a modern GPU gives up to 26-fold speed-up. Furthermore,
	using our parallel processing framework, this speed-up increases
	linearly with the number of CPUs or GPUs used. Thus, it is now possible
	to use routinely more robust but more expensive 3D correlation techniques.
	When tested on low resolution experimental cryo-EM data for the GroEL-GroES
	complex, we demonstrate the satisfactory fitting results that may
	be achieved by using a locally normalised cross-correlation with
	a Laplacian pre-filter, while still being up to three orders of magnitude
	faster than the well-known COLORES program.},

  abstract = {Cryo-electron tomography (CET) is a three-dimensional imaging technique
	for structural studies of macromolecules under close-to-native conditions.
	In-depth analysis of macromolecule populations depicted in tomograms
	requires identification of subtomograms corresponding to putative
	particles, averaging of subtomograms to enhance their signal, and
	classification to capture the structural variations among them. Here,
	we introduce the open-source platform PyTom that unifies standard
	tomogram processing steps in a python toolbox. For subtomogram averaging,
	we implemented an adaptive adjustment of scoring and sampling that
	clearly improves the resolution of averages compared to static strategies.
	Furthermore, we present a novel stochastic classification method
	that yields significantly more accurate classification results than
	two deterministic approaches in simulations. We demonstrate that
	the PyTom workflow yields faithful results for alignment and classification
	of simulated and experimental subtomograms of ribosomes and GroEL(14)/GroEL(14)GroES(7),
	respectively, as well as for the analysis of ribosomal 60S subunits
	in yeast cell lysate. PyTom enables parallelized processing of large
	numbers of tomograms, but also provides a convenient, sustainable
	environment for algorithmic development.},

  abstract = {Accurate maps of large macromolecular complexes can be calculated
	from cryo-electron micrographs of non-crystalline specimens to resolutions
	of about 10 A. A method to dock the atomic structures of domains
	solved by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance into
	cryo-EM maps is presented. Domains can be docked independently into
	large complexes without prior definition of the boundaries. No special
	symmetry is assumed and the procedure is suitable for general application
	to almost any system where a cryo-EM map (at 15 A resolution or better)
	of a complex has been obtained and the atomic structures of the components
	are available. This is achieved through use of a real-space density-matching
	procedure based on local correlation. A complete asymmetric unit
	search correlating a density object derived from the atomic coordinates
	and the density of the EM map is performed. The correlation coefficient
	is calculated locally in real space using only values of the search
	object and corresponding samples extracted from the EM map which
	are under the 'footprint' of the positioned search object. The procedure
	has been demonstrated by docking the domains of GroEL from the crystal
	structure into a cryo-EM map Fourier filtered to 12 or 15 A resolution.
	The correct positions were found without applying any additional
	constraints. A model of the oligomer built from the docked domains
	compared favourably with the known crystal structure, confirming
	the validity of the approach. The procedure is designed to facilitate
	the incorporation of additional constraints on the docking solutions,
	which could help to dock using lower resolution maps.},

	Initial recruitment of the SRP receptor FtsY to the SRP-RNC complex

  abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy of "single particles" is a powerful method
	to analyze structures of large macromolecular assemblies that are
	not amenable to investigation by traditional X-ray crystallographic
	methods. A key step in these studies is to obtain atomic interpretations
	of multiprotein complexes by fitting atomic structures of individual
	components into maps obtained from electron microscopic data. Here,
	we report the use of a "core-weighting" method, combined with a grid-threading
	Monte Carlo (GTMC) approach for this purpose. The "core" of an individual
	structure is defined to represent the part where the density distribution
	is least likely to be altered by other components that comprise the
	macromolecular assembly of interest. The performance of the method
	has been evaluated by its ability to determine the correct fit of
	(i) the alpha-chain of the T-cell receptor variable domain into a
	simulated map of the alphabeta complex at resolutions between 5 and
	40 A, and (ii) the E2 catalytic domain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
	into an experimentally determined map, at 14 A resolution, of the
	icosahedral complex formed by 60 copies of this enzyme. Using the
	X-ray structures of the two test cases as references, we demonstrate
	that, in contrast to more traditional methods, the combination of
	the core-weighting method and the grid-threading Monte Carlo approach
	can identify the correct fit reliably and rapidly from the low-resolution
