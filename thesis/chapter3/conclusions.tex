\Section{Conclusions}

Here we have explored the resolution limits of rigid body fitting in
high-resolution cryo-EM densities, ranging between 5.5 and 6.9\Angstrom\ 
resolution, using 5 different ribosome cases. We have shown that also for
experimental data the L-CW-LCC score is the most sensitive of the 4
correlation-based scores tested and that it can unambiguously fit most chains
objectively at the correct location. In addition, we quantified the success
rate of fitting subunits based on their size represented by their number of
residues. As expected, larger subunits require a lower level of detail to be
unambiguously fitted into the density. This phenomenon can be leveraged by
building an image pyramid, i.e.  representing the data at different
resolutions, and subsequently fitting a subunit in the smaller,
lower-resolution density dataset. The resulting speed increase can be up to
30-fold for CPUs and 40-fold for GPUs with virtually no loss in the success
rate of fitting. We have implemented the use of image-pyramids in PowerFit for
fast objective fitting of high-resolution structures in lower-resolution
density maps.
