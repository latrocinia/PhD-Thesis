	protein-protein interactions. A variety of docking programs with
	different sampling algorithms and scoring functions as well as computational
	efficiencies have been subsequently developed over the last decades.
	Here, we have reviewed the trend and performance of current global
	docking programs through a comprehensive assessment of the 18 docking/scoring
	protocols of 14 global docking programs on the latest protein docking
	benchmark 4.0. The effects of docking algorithms, interaction types,
	and conformational changes on the docking performance were investigated
	and discussed. The findings are expected to provide a general guideline
	for the choice of an appropriate docking protocol and offer insights
	into the optimization and development of docking and scoring algorithms.},

	spectrometry into ROSETTA protocols for comparative and de novo modeling
	and protein-protein docking. We demonstrate that the cross-link validation
	and visualization software Xwalk facilitates successful cross-link

	of chemical cross-links from 14 different publications with 506 intra-protein
	and 62 inter-protein cross-links, where each cross-link can be mapped
	on an experimental structure from the Protein Data Bank. Finally,
	we demonstrate on a protein-protein docking reference data set the
	impact of virtual cross-links on protein docking calculations and
	show that an inter-protein cross-link can reduce on average the RMSD
	of a docking prediction by 5.0 Å. The methods and results presented
	here provide guidelines for the effective integration of chemical

	of an orthogonal cross-linking chemistry specific for carboxyl groups.
	Chemical cross-linking of acidic residues is achieved using homobifunctional
	dihydrazides as cross-linking reagents and a coupling chemistry at
	neutral pH that is compatible with the structural integrity of most
	protein complexes. In addition to cross-links formed through insertion

	products are also obtained, thereby providing additional structural
	information. We demonstrate the application of the reaction and the
	MS identification of the resulting cross-linked peptides for the
	chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the 26S proteasome. The results indicate
	that the targeting of acidic residues for cross-linking provides
	distance restraints that are complementary and orthogonal to those
	obtained from lysine cross-linking, thereby expanding the yield of

  abstract = {Integrative structural biology attempts to model the structures of
	protein complexes that are challenging or intractable by classical
	structural methods (due to size, dynamics, or heterogeneity) by combining
	computational structural modeling with data from experimental methods.
	One such experimental method is chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry
	(XL-MS), in which protein complexes are crosslinked and characterized
	using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to pinpoint specific
	amino acid residues in close structural proximity. The commonly used
	lysine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester reagents disuccinimidylsuberate
	(DSS) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS(3) ) have a linker arm
	that is 11.4 Å long when fully extended, allowing Cα (alpha carbon
	of protein backbone) atoms of crosslinked lysine residues to be up
	to ∼24 Å apart. However, XL-MS studies on proteins of known structure
	frequently report crosslinks that exceed this distance. Typically,
	a tolerance of ∼3 Å is added to the theoretical maximum to account
	for this observation, with limited justification for the chosen value.
	We used the Dynameomics database, a repository of high-quality molecular
	dynamics simulations of 807 proteins representative of diverse protein
	folds, to investigate the relationship between lysine-lysine distances
	in experimental starting structures and in simulation ensembles.
	We conclude that for DSS/BS(3), a distance constraint of 26-30 Å
	between Cα atoms is appropriate. This analysis provides a theoretical
	basis for the widespread practice of adding a tolerance to the crosslinker
	length when comparing XL-MS results to structures or in modeling.
	We also discuss the comparison of XL-MS results to MD simulations
	and known structures as a means to test and validate experimental
	XL-MS methods.},

  abstract = {The protein-protein docking problem is one of the focal points of
	activity in computational biophysics and structural biology. The
	three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally,
	is more difficult to determine experimentally than the structure
	of an individual protein. Adequate computational techniques to model
	protein interactions are important because of the growing number
	of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural
	genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein
	interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein
	docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given
	the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking
	methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity
	at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution,
	experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein
	structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the
	focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures.
	Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between
	unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the
	interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed
	for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing
	number of docking developers is engaged in the community-wide assessments
	of predictive methodologies. The development of more powerful and
	adequate docking approaches is facilitated by rapidly expanding information
	and data resources, growing computational capabilities, and a deeper
	understanding of the fundamental principles of protein interactions.},
