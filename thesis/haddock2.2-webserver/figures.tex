{The worldwide distribution of registered users (>5500) is shown with a
blue-scale color-coding. On the top right, the distribution of the type of
systems docked using HADDOCK is shown (taken from a HADDOCK online survey with
>325 respondents). The middle bar graph shows the yearly increase in the number
of registered users since 2010 and the bottom plot shows the number of
processed user runs per month since last year (2014), distinguishing between
runs that have been processed on our local resources or on the EGI grid
resources, and between the previous and current (2.2) version of the server.}
