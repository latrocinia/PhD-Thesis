	enhancements, pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings due

	Curie relaxation and nuclear-nuclear dipolar relaxation. The complete
	program has been tested by back-calculating NOEs and paramagnetism-based
	restraints from the X-ray structure of cytochrome c (553) from B.
	pasteurii. Furthermore, the same experimental restraints previously
	used to determine the solution structure of cytochrome c (553) itself,
	of cytochrome b (5), and of calbindin D(9k) with the program PARAMAGNETIC
	DYANA, have been used for structure calculations by using PARArestraints
	for Xplor-NIH. The agreement between the two programs is quite satisfactory
	and validates both protocols.},

  abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum
	solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and
	local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily
	on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement
	and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of
	covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections
	can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics
	are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual
	rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically
	important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional
	structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes
	in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything
	from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building
	to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography
	easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors
	that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution
	and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a
	few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched
	protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both
	for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy
	and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors
	in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping
	solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities,
	reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that
	the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global
	database.},

  title = {CPORT: a consensus interface predictor and its performance in prediction-driven
	docking with HADDOCK.},
  journal = {PLoS One},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {6},

  abstract = {Macromolecular complexes are the molecular machines of the cell. Knowledge
	at the atomic level is essential to understand and influence their
	function. However, their number is huge and a significant fraction
	is extremely difficult to study using classical structural methods
	such as NMR and X-ray crystallography. Therefore, the importance
	of large-scale computational approaches in structural biology is
	evident. This study combines two of these computational approaches,
	interface prediction and docking, to obtain atomic-level structures
	of protein-protein complexes, starting from their unbound components.Here
	we combine six interface prediction web servers into a consensus
	method called CPORT (Consensus Prediction Of interface Residues in
	Transient complexes). We show that CPORT gives more stable and reliable
	predictions than each of the individual predictors on its own. A
	protocol was developed to integrate CPORT predictions into our data-driven
	docking program HADDOCK. For cases where experimental information
	is limited, this prediction-driven docking protocol presents an alternative
	to ab initio docking, the docking of complexes without the use of
	any information. Prediction-driven docking was performed on a large
	and diverse set of protein-protein complexes in a blind manner. Our
	results indicate that the performance of the HADDOCK-CPORT combination
	is competitive with ZDOCK-ZRANK, a state-of-the-art ab initio docking/scoring
	combination. Finally, the original interface predictions could be
	further improved by interface post-prediction (contact analysis of
	the docking solutions).The current study shows that blind, prediction-driven
	docking using CPORT and HADDOCK is competitive with ab initio docking
	methods. This is encouraging since prediction-driven docking represents
	the absolute bottom line for data-driven docking: any additional
	biological knowledge will greatly improve the results obtained by
	prediction-driven docking alone. Finally, the fact that original
	interface predictions could be further improved by interface post-prediction
	suggests that prediction-driven docking has not yet been pushed to
	the limit. A web server for CPORT is freely available at http://haddock.chem.uu.nl/services/CPORT.},

	improvements and new features. HADDOCK is now able to model not only
	protein-protein complexes but also other kinds of biomolecular complexes
	and multi-component (N > 2) systems. In the absence of any experimental
	and/or predicted information to drive the docking, HADDOCK now offers
	two additional ab initio docking modes based on either random patch
	definition or center-of-mass restraints. The docking protocol has
	been considerably improved, supporting among other solvated docking,
	automatic definition of semi-flexible regions, and inclusion of a
	desolvation energy term in the scoring scheme. The performance of
	HADDOCK2.0 is evaluated on the targets of rounds 4-11, run in a semi-automated
	mode using the original information we used in our CAPRI submissions.
	This enables a direct assessment of the progress made since the previous
	versions. Although HADDOCK performed very well in CAPRI (65\% and
	71\% success rates, overall and for unbound targets only, respectively),
	a substantial improvement was achieved with HADDOCK2.0.},

	Several methods based on docking to study protein complexes have

	of energetics and shape complementarity. Here, we present an approach

	Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process.
	An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown
	to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is
	demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes,
	for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been
	solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were

  abstract = {DAXX is a scaffold protein with diverse roles that often depend upon
	binding SUMO via its N- and/or C-terminal SUMO-interacting motifs
	(SIM-N and SIM-C). Using NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the in
	vitro binding properties of peptide models of SIM-N and SIM-C to
	SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. In each case, binding was mediated by hydrophobic
	and electrostatic interactions and weakened with increasing ionic
	strength. Neither isolated SIM showed any significant paralog specificity,
	and the measured Î¼M range K(D) values of SIM-N toward both SUMO-1
	and SUMO-2 were â¼4-fold lower than those of SIM-C. Furthermore, SIM-N
	bound SUMO-1 predominantly in a parallel orientation, whereas SIM-C
	interconverted between parallel and antiparallel binding modes on
	an ms to Î¼s time scale. The differences in affinities and binding
	modes are attributed to the differences in charged residues that
	flank the otherwise identical hydrophobic core sequences of the two
	SIMs. In addition, within its native context, SIM-N bound intramolecularly
	to the adjacent N-terminal helical bundle domain of DAXX, thus reducing
	its apparent affinity for SUMO. This behavior suggests a possible
	autoregulatory mechanism for DAXX. The interaction of a C-terminal
	fragment of DAXX with an N-terminal fragment of the sumoylated Ets1
	transcription factor was mediated by SIM-C. Importantly, this interaction
	did not involve any direct contacts between DAXX and Ets1, but rather
	was derived from the non-covalent binding of SIM-C to SUMO-1, which
	in turn was covalently linked to the unstructured N-terminal segment
	of Ets1. These results provide insights into the binding mechanisms
	and hence biological roles of the DAXX SUMO-interacting motifs.},

  abstract = {Scoring, the process of selecting the biologically relevant solution
	from a pool of generated conformations, is one of the major challenges
	in the field of biomolecular docking. A prominent way to cope with
	this challenge is to incorporate information-based terms into the
	scoring function. Within this context, low-resolution shape data
	obtained from either ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) or SAXS
	experiments have been integrated into the conventional scoring function
	of the information-driven docking program HADDOCK. Here, the strengths
	and weaknesses of IM-MS-based and SAXS-based scoring, either in isolation
	or in combination with the HADDOCK score, are systematically assessed.
	The results of an analysis of a large docking decoy set composed
	of dimers generated by running HADDOCK in ab initio mode reveal that
	the content of the IM-MS data is of too low resolution for selecting
	correct models, while scoring with SAXS data leads to a significant
	improvement in performance. However, the effectiveness of SAXS scoring
	depends on the shape and the arrangement of the complex, with prolate

  abstract = {Over the last years, large scale proteomics studies have generated
	a wealth of information of biomolecular complexes. Adding the structural
	dimension to the resulting interactomes represents a major challenge
	that classical structural experimental methods alone will have difficulties
	to confront. To meet this challenge, complementary modeling techniques
	such as docking are thus needed. Among the current docking methods,
	HADDOCK (High Ambiguity-Driven DOCKing) distinguishes itself from
	others by the use of experimental and/or bioinformatics data to drive
	the modeling process and has shown a strong performance in the critical
	assessment of prediction of interactions (CAPRI), a blind experiment
	for the prediction of interactions. Although most docking programs
	are limited to binary complexes, HADDOCK can deal with multiple molecules
	(up to six), a capability that will be required to build large macromolecular
	assemblies. We present here a novel web interface of HADDOCK that
	allows the user to dock up to six biomolecules simultaneously. This
	interface allows the inclusion of a large variety of both experimental
	and/or bioinformatics data and supports several types of cyclic and
	dihedral symmetries in the docking of multibody assemblies. The server
	was tested on a benchmark of six cases, containing five symmetric
	homo-oligomeric protein complexes and one symmetric protein-DNA complex.
	Our results reveal that, in the presence of either bioinformatics
	and/or experimental data, HADDOCK shows an excellent performance:
	in all cases, HADDOCK was able to generate good to high quality solutions
	and ranked them at the top, demonstrating its ability to model symmetric
	multicomponent assemblies. Docking methods can thus play an important
	role in adding the structural dimension to interactomes. However,
	although the current docking methodologies were successful for a
	vast range of cases, considering the variety and complexity of macromolecular
	assemblies, inclusion of some kind of experimental information (e.g.
	from mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryoelectron
	microscopy, etc.) will remain highly desirable to obtain reliable
	results.},

	the wealth of structural information gathered by large-scale initiatives
	allows for homology-based modeling of a significant fraction of the

	This indicates that a well-defined overall fold is critical for the

	to characterize the interaction plays a determinant role in the success

	acceptable predictions even at low global sequence identity. These
