\startBackmatterHead[title=Acknowledgements]

Now after 3 years 11 months and a couple days of hard work while finishing the
PhD and wrapping it up, its an apt time to reminisce about how I got here and
give thanks where thanks is required and deserved. My earliest notions of what
I wanted to be are during the kleuterklas, where I actually wanted to be a
lawyer, as it was a well respected and well paid job, in contrast to my friends
who wanted to become a "sloper", a job that I to this day doubt exists. My
aspirations changed though during primary school, where I wanted to become rich
quickly so I could become a hermit scientist to invent ultimate weapons to conquer the
world. In this respect I partly am doing currently what I already planned since
I was about 10. However, the first real interest in science showed when I was
reading of few editions of an encyclopedia series, touching on diverse areas of
research, that my parents had bought. The fact that if you would squeeze out
all the empty space in atoms and condense them to pure matter would shrink a skyscraper to the
size of a nut fascinated me.
