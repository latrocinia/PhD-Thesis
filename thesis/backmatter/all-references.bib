	powerful tools for structure prediction and optimization in the absence
	of experimental data. In recent years, a synergy between these computational
	methods for crystallographic structure determination and structure
	prediction and optimization has begun to be exploited. We review
	some of the advances in the algorithms used for crystallographic
	structure determination in the Phenix and Crystallography & NMR System
	software packages and describe how methods from ab initio structure
	prediction and refinement in Rosetta have been applied to challenging

	is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented

  abstract = {To understand the cell, we need to determine the macromolecular assembly

	First, we review the varied experimental data that characterize the
	assemblies at several levels of resolution. We then describe computational
	methods for generating the structures using these data. To maximize
	completeness, resolution, accuracy, precision, and efficiency of
	the structure determination, a computational approach is required
	that uses spatial information from a variety of experimental methods.
	We propose such an approach, defined by its three main components:
	a hierarchical representation of the assembly, a scoring function
	consisting of spatial restraints derived from experimental data,
	and an optimization method that generates structures consistent with
	the data. This approach is illustrated by determining the configuration
	of the 456 proteins in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) from baker's
	yeast. With these tools, we are poised to integrate structural information
	gathered at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy--from atoms

  abstract = {An atomic scale interpretation facilitates the assignment of functional
	properties to 3D reconstructions of macromolecular assemblies in

	typically achieved by docking the known atomic structures of components
	into the volumetric EM maps. Docking locations are often determined
	by maximizing the cross-correlation coefficient of the two objects
	in a slow, exhaustive search. If time is of essence, such as in related
	visualization and image processing fields, the matching of data is
	accelerated by incorporating feature points that form a compact description
	of 3D objects. The complexity reduction afforded by the feature point
	representation enables a near-instantaneous matching. We show that
	such reduced matching can also deliver robust and accurate results
	in the presence of noise or artifacts. We therefore propose a novel
	multi-resolution registration technique employing feature-based shape
	descriptions of the volumetric and structural data. The pattern-matching
	algorithm carries out a hierarchical alignment of the point sets
	generated by vector quantization. The search-space complexity is
	reduced by an integrated tree-pruning technique, which permits the
	detection of subunits in large macromolecular assemblies in real-time.
	The efficiency and accuracy of the novel algorithm are validated

	of many proteins. How these substrate proteins are encapsulated within

	single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have characterized a
	chemically modified mutant of GroEL (EL43Py) that is trapped at a
	normally transient stage of substrate protein encapsulation. We show
	that the symmetric pattern of the GroEL subunits is broken as the
	GroEL cis-ring apical domains reorient to accommodate the simultaneous
	binding of GroES and an incompletely folded substrate protein (RuBisCO).
	The collapsed RuBisCO folding intermediate binds to the lower segment
	of two apical domains, as well as to the normally unstructured GroEL
	C-terminal tails. A comparative structural analysis suggests that
	the allosteric transitions leading to substrate protein release and
	folding involve concerted shifts of GroES and the GroEL apical domains
	and C-terminal tails.},

  title = {The use of residual dipolar coupling in studying proteins by NMR.},
  journal = {Top Curr Chem},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {326},
  pages = {47--67},
  abstract = {The development of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in protein NMR
	spectroscopy, over a decade ago, has become a useful and almost routine
	tool for accurate protein solution structure determination. RDCs
	provide orientation information of magnetic dipole-dipole interaction
	vectors within a common reference frame. Its measurement requires
	a nonisotropic orientation, through a direct or indirect magnetic
	field alignment, of the protein in solution. There has been recent
	progress in the developments of alignment methods to allow the measurement
	of RDC and of methods to analyze the resulting data. In this chapter
	we briefly go through the mathematical expressions for the RDC and
	common descriptions of the alignment tensor, which may be represented
	using either Saupe order or the principal order matrix. Then we review
	the latest developments in alignment media. In particular we looked
	at the lipid-compatible media that allow the measurement of RDCs
	for membrane proteins. Other methods including conservative surface
	residue mutation have been invented to obtain up to five orthogonal
	alignment tensors that provide a potential for de novo structure
	and dynamics study using RDCs exclusively. We then discuss approximations
	assumed in RDC interpretations and different views on dynamics uncovered
	from the RDC method. In addition to routine usage of RDCs in refining
	a single structure, novel applications such as ensemble refinement
	against RDCs have been implemented to represent protein structure
	and dynamics in solution. The RDC application also extends to the
	study of protein-substrate interaction as well as to solving quaternary
	structure of oligomer in equilibrium with a monomer, opening an avenue
	for RDCs in high-order protein structure determination.},

	covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections
	can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics
	are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual
	rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically
	important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional
	structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes
	in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything
	from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building
	to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography
	easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors
	that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution
	and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a
	few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched
	protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both
	for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy
	and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors
	in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping
	solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities,
	reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that

  abstract = {Macromolecular complexes are the molecular machines of the cell. Knowledge
	at the atomic level is essential to understand and influence their
	function. However, their number is huge and a significant fraction
	is extremely difficult to study using classical structural methods
	such as NMR and X-ray crystallography. Therefore, the importance
	of large-scale computational approaches in structural biology is
	evident. This study combines two of these computational approaches,
	interface prediction and docking, to obtain atomic-level structures
	of protein-protein complexes, starting from their unbound components.Here
	we combine six interface prediction web servers into a consensus
	method called CPORT (Consensus Prediction Of interface Residues in
	Transient complexes). We show that CPORT gives more stable and reliable
	predictions than each of the individual predictors on its own. A
	protocol was developed to integrate CPORT predictions into our data-driven
	docking program HADDOCK. For cases where experimental information
	is limited, this prediction-driven docking protocol presents an alternative
	to ab initio docking, the docking of complexes without the use of
	any information. Prediction-driven docking was performed on a large
	and diverse set of protein-protein complexes in a blind manner. Our
	results indicate that the performance of the HADDOCK-CPORT combination
	is competitive with ZDOCK-ZRANK, a state-of-the-art ab initio docking/scoring
	combination. Finally, the original interface predictions could be
	further improved by interface post-prediction (contact analysis of
	the docking solutions).The current study shows that blind, prediction-driven
	docking using CPORT and HADDOCK is competitive with ab initio docking
	methods. This is encouraging since prediction-driven docking represents
	the absolute bottom line for data-driven docking: any additional
	biological knowledge will greatly improve the results obtained by
	prediction-driven docking alone. Finally, the fact that original
	interface predictions could be further improved by interface post-prediction
	suggests that prediction-driven docking has not yet been pushed to
	the limit. A web server for CPORT is freely available at http://haddock.chem.uu.nl/services/CPORT.},

  abstract = {The recent CAPRI rounds have introduced new docking challenges in
	the form of protein-RNA complexes, multiple alternative interfaces,
	and an unprecedented number of targets for which homology modeling
	was required. We present here the performance of HADDOCK and its
	web server in the CAPRI experiment and discuss the strengths and
	weaknesses of data-driven docking. HADDOCK was successful for 6 out
	of 9 complexes (6 out of 11 targets) and accurately predicted the
	individual interfaces for two more complexes. The HADDOCK server,
	which is the first allowing the simultaneous docking of generic multi-body
	complexes, was successful in 4 out of 7 complexes for which it participated.
	In the scoring experiment, we predicted the highest number of targets
	of any group. The main weakness of data-driven docking revealed from
	these last CAPRI results is its vulnerability for incorrect experimental
	data related to the interface or the stoichiometry of the complex.
	At the same time, the use of experimental and/or predicted information
	is also the strength of our approach as evidenced for those targets
	for which accurate experimental information was available (e.g.,
	the 10 three-stars predictions for T40!). Even when the models show
	a wrong orientation, the individual interfaces are generally well
	predicted with an average coverage of 60\% Â± 26\% over all targets.
	This makes data-driven docking particularly valuable in a biological
	context to guide experimental studies like, for example, targeted
	mutagenesis.},

	two additional ab initio docking modes based on either random patch

	been considerably improved, supporting among other solvated docking,
	automatic definition of semi-flexible regions, and inclusion of a

	HADDOCK2.0 is evaluated on the targets of rounds 4-11, run in a semi-automated
	mode using the original information we used in our CAPRI submissions.
	This enables a direct assessment of the progress made since the previous

	Several methods based on docking to study protein complexes have

	An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown

	demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes,
	for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been
	solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were

	(SIM-N and SIM-C). Using NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the in
	vitro binding properties of peptide models of SIM-N and SIM-C to
	SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. In each case, binding was mediated by hydrophobic
	and electrostatic interactions and weakened with increasing ionic
	strength. Neither isolated SIM showed any significant paralog specificity,
	and the measured Î¼M range K(D) values of SIM-N toward both SUMO-1
	and SUMO-2 were â¼4-fold lower than those of SIM-C. Furthermore, SIM-N
	bound SUMO-1 predominantly in a parallel orientation, whereas SIM-C
	interconverted between parallel and antiparallel binding modes on
	an ms to Î¼s time scale. The differences in affinities and binding
	modes are attributed to the differences in charged residues that
	flank the otherwise identical hydrophobic core sequences of the two
	SIMs. In addition, within its native context, SIM-N bound intramolecularly
	to the adjacent N-terminal helical bundle domain of DAXX, thus reducing
	its apparent affinity for SUMO. This behavior suggests a possible
	autoregulatory mechanism for DAXX. The interaction of a C-terminal
	fragment of DAXX with an N-terminal fragment of the sumoylated Ets1
	transcription factor was mediated by SIM-C. Importantly, this interaction
	did not involve any direct contacts between DAXX and Ets1, but rather
	was derived from the non-covalent binding of SIM-C to SUMO-1, which
	in turn was covalently linked to the unstructured N-terminal segment
	of Ets1. These results provide insights into the binding mechanisms

	The new protocol for global docking based on multi-start global energy

	microscopy, we have determined the structure of the 30S subunit bound

	factors, as well as A-, P-site tRNAs and the 50S subunit. Further
	structural analysis not only provides a structural model for the
	RsgA-dependent release of RbfA from the nascent 30S subunit, but

	promote some tertiary binding protein incorporation. Moreover, together
	with available biochemical and genetic data, our results suggest
	that RsgA might be a general checkpoint protein in the late stage
	of the 30S subunit biogenesis, whose function is not only to release
	biogenesis factors (e.g., RbfA) from the nascent 30S subunit, but

	both the translational and rotational parts of the correlation search.
	In particular, by using the GPU's special texture memory hardware

	on one core of a contemporary central processor unit (CPU), running

	using our parallel processing framework, this speed-up increases
	linearly with the number of CPUs or GPUs used. Thus, it is now possible
	to use routinely more robust but more expensive 3D correlation techniques.
	When tested on low resolution experimental cryo-EM data for the GroEL-GroES

	Experimental screens have identified tens of thousands of interactions,

	select 3D protein complexes. An alternative rich source of information
	about protein interactions is the evolutionary sequence record. Building
	on earlier work, we show that analysis of correlated evolutionary
	sequence changes across proteins identifies residues that are close
	in space with sufficient accuracy to determine the three-dimensional
	structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate prediction performance
	in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure, predict protein-protein
	contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and demonstrate how
	evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between interacting
	and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the current
	growth of sequences, we expect that the method can be generalized
	to genome-wide elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks
	and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.},

	In-depth analysis of macromolecule populations depicted in tomograms

	classification to capture the structural variations among them. Here,
	we introduce the open-source platform PyTom that unifies standard

	we implemented an adaptive adjustment of scoring and sampling that
	clearly improves the resolution of averages compared to static strategies.
	Furthermore, we present a novel stochastic classification method
	that yields significantly more accurate classification results than
	two deterministic approaches in simulations. We demonstrate that
	the PyTom workflow yields faithful results for alignment and classification
	of simulated and experimental subtomograms of ribosomes and GroEL(14)/GroEL(14)GroES(7),

	present recent structural and systematic functional data that elucidate
	the molecular basis of how p53 is inactivated by different types

	response to mutation determines: (i) the folding state of a particular
	mutant under physiological conditions; (ii) its affinity for the
	various p53 target DNA sequences; and (iii) its protein-protein interactions
	both within the p53 tetramer and with a multitude of regulatory proteins.
	Further, the structural details of individual mutants provide the
	basis for the design of specific and generic drugs for cancer therapy
	purposes. In combination with studies on second-site suppressor mutations,

	as an assembly of subparts/domains that are docked simultaneously

  abstract = {Over the last years, large scale proteomics studies have generated
	a wealth of information of biomolecular complexes. Adding the structural
	dimension to the resulting interactomes represents a major challenge
	that classical structural experimental methods alone will have difficulties
	to confront. To meet this challenge, complementary modeling techniques
	such as docking are thus needed. Among the current docking methods,
	HADDOCK (High Ambiguity-Driven DOCKing) distinguishes itself from
	others by the use of experimental and/or bioinformatics data to drive
	the modeling process and has shown a strong performance in the critical
	assessment of prediction of interactions (CAPRI), a blind experiment
	for the prediction of interactions. Although most docking programs
	are limited to binary complexes, HADDOCK can deal with multiple molecules
	(up to six), a capability that will be required to build large macromolecular
	assemblies. We present here a novel web interface of HADDOCK that
	allows the user to dock up to six biomolecules simultaneously. This
	interface allows the inclusion of a large variety of both experimental
	and/or bioinformatics data and supports several types of cyclic and
	dihedral symmetries in the docking of multibody assemblies. The server
	was tested on a benchmark of six cases, containing five symmetric
	homo-oligomeric protein complexes and one symmetric protein-DNA complex.
	Our results reveal that, in the presence of either bioinformatics
	and/or experimental data, HADDOCK shows an excellent performance:
	in all cases, HADDOCK was able to generate good to high quality solutions
	and ranked them at the top, demonstrating its ability to model symmetric
	multicomponent assemblies. Docking methods can thus play an important
	role in adding the structural dimension to interactomes. However,
	although the current docking methodologies were successful for a
	vast range of cases, considering the variety and complexity of macromolecular
	assemblies, inclusion of some kind of experimental information (e.g.
	from mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryoelectron
	microscopy, etc.) will remain highly desirable to obtain reliable

  abstract = {Recently, electron microscopy measurement of single particles has
	enabled us to reconstruct a low-resolution 3D density map of large
	biomolecular complexes. If structures of the complex subunits can
	be solved by x-ray crystallography at atomic resolution, fitting
	these models into the 3D density map can generate an atomic resolution
	model of the entire large complex. The fitting of multiple subunits,
	however, generally requires large computational costs; therefore,
	development of an efficient algorithm is required. We developed a
	fast fitting program, "gmfit", which employs a Gaussian mixture model
	(GMM) to represent approximated shapes of the 3D density map and
	the atomic models. A GMM is a distribution function composed by adding
	together several 3D Gaussian density functions. Because our model
	analytically provides an integral of a product of two distribution
	functions, it enables us to quickly calculate the fitness of the
	density map and the atomic models. Using the integral, two types
	of potential energy function are introduced: the attraction potential
	energy between a 3D density map and each subunit, and the repulsion
	potential energy between subunits. The restraint energy for symmetry
	is also employed to build symmetrical origomeric complexes. To find
	the optimal configuration of subunits, we randomly generated initial
	configurations of subunit models, and performed a steepest-descent
	method using forces and torques of the three potential energies.
	Comparison between an original density map and its GMM showed that
	the required number of Gaussian distribution functions for a given
	accuracy depended on both resolution and molecular size. We then
	performed test fitting calculations for simulated low-resolution
	density maps of atomic models of homodimer, trimer, and hexamer,
	using different search parameters. The results indicated that our
	method was able to rebuild atomic models of a complex even for maps
	of 30 A resolution if sufficient numbers (eight or more) of Gaussian
	distribution functions were employed for each subunit, and the symmetric
	restraints were assigned for complexes with more than three subunits.
	As a more realistic test, we tried to build an atomic model of the
	GroEL/ES complex by fitting 21-subunit atomic models into the 3D
	density map obtained by cryoelectron microscopy using the C7 symmetric
	restraints. A model with low root mean-square deviations (14.7 A)
	was obtained as the lowest-energy model, showing that our fitting
	method was reasonably accurate. Inclusion of other restraints from
	biological and biochemical experiments could further enhance the
	accuracy.},

  abstract = {The 'fast rotational matching' method (an approach to find the three
	rotational degrees of freedom in matching problems using just one
	three-dimensional FFT) is extended to the full six-dimensional (rotation
	and translation) matching scenario between two three-dimensional
	objects. By recasting this problem into a formulation involving five
	angles and just one translational parameter, it was possible to accelerate,
	by means of fast Fourier transforms, five of the six degrees of freedom
	of the problem. This method was successfully applied to the docking
	of atomic structures of components into three-dimensional low-resolution
	density maps. Timing comparisons performed with our method and with
	'fast translational matching' (the standard way to accelerate the
	translational parameters utilizing fast Fourier transforms) demonstrates
	that the performance gain can reach several orders of magnitude,
	especially for large map sizes. This gain can be particularly advantageous
	for spherical- and toroidal-shaped maps, since the scanning range
	of the translational parameter would be significantly constrained
	in these cases. The method can also be harnessed to the complementary
	surface (or 'exterior docking') problem and to pattern recognition
	in image processing.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to protein-protein docking sample the binding
	modes with no regard to similar experimentally determined structures
	(templates) of protein-protein complexes. Emerging template-based
	docking approaches utilize such similar complexes to determine the
	docking predictions. The docking problem assumes the knowledge of
	the participating proteins' structures. Thus, it provides the possibility
	of aligning the structures of the proteins and the template complexes.
	The progress in the development of template-based docking and the
	vast experience in template-based modeling of individual proteins
	show that, generally, such approaches are more reliable than the
	free modeling. The key aspect of this modeling paradigm is the availability
	of the templates. The current common perception is that due to the
	difficulties in experimental structure determination of protein-protein
	complexes, the pool of docking templates is insignificant, and thus
	a broad application of template-based docking is possible only at
	some future time. The results of our large scale, systematic study
	show that, surprisingly, in spite of the limited number of protein-protein
	complexes in the Protein Data Bank, docking templates can be found
	for complexes representing almost all the known protein-protein interactions,
	provided the components themselves have a known structure or can
	be homology-built. About one-third of the templates are of good quality
	when they are compared to experimental structures in test sets extracted
	from the Protein Data Bank and would be useful starting points in
	modeling the complexes. This finding dramatically expands our ability
	to model protein interactions, and has far-reaching implications
	for the protein docking field in general.},

	limited by the host neutralizing immune response. The cryo-electron
	microscopy (EM) structure at 8.5Ã resolution is determined for a
	complex of AAV-2 with the Fab' fragment of monoclonal antibody (MAb)
	A20, the most extensively characterized AAV MAb. The binding footprint
	is determined through fitting the cryo-EM reconstruction with a homology
	model following sequencing of the variable domain, and provides a
	structural basis for integrating diverse prior epitope mappings.
	The footprint extends from the previously implicated plateau to the
	side of the spike, and into the conserved canyon, covering a larger
	area than anticipated. Comparison with structures of binding and
	non-binding serotypes indicates that recognition depends on a combination
	of subtle serotype-specific features. Separation of the neutralizing
	epitope from the heparan sulfate cell attachment site encourages
	attempts to develop immune-resistant vectors that can still bind
	to target cells.},

	structural methods (due to size, dynamics, or heterogeneity) by combining

	One such experimental method is chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry
	(XL-MS), in which protein complexes are crosslinked and characterized
	using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to pinpoint specific
	amino acid residues in close structural proximity. The commonly used
	lysine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester reagents disuccinimidylsuberate
	(DSS) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS(3) ) have a linker arm
	that is 11.4 Ã long when fully extended, allowing CÎ± (alpha carbon
	of protein backbone) atoms of crosslinked lysine residues to be up
	to â¼24 Ã apart. However, XL-MS studies on proteins of known structure
	frequently report crosslinks that exceed this distance. Typically,
	a tolerance of â¼3 Ã is added to the theoretical maximum to account
	for this observation, with limited justification for the chosen value.
	We used the Dynameomics database, a repository of high-quality molecular
	dynamics simulations of 807 proteins representative of diverse protein
	folds, to investigate the relationship between lysine-lysine distances
	in experimental starting structures and in simulation ensembles.
	We conclude that for DSS/BS(3), a distance constraint of 26-30 Ã
	between CÎ± atoms is appropriate. This analysis provides a theoretical
	basis for the widespread practice of adding a tolerance to the crosslinker
	length when comparing XL-MS results to structures or in modeling.
	We also discuss the comparison of XL-MS results to MD simulations
	and known structures as a means to test and validate experimental
	XL-MS methods.},

	Real-space correlations calculated over a local area are suitable
	for finding small objects or patterns in a larger field. They provide
	a very sensitive measure-of-fit, partly due to local optimisation
	of the numerical scaling. It is equivalent to least squares with
	optimised scaling between the two objects being correlated. The only
	disadvantage of real-space methods is that they are slow to compute.
	A fast local correlation algorithm based on Fourier transforms has

	by application to the problem of locating images of macromolecules
	in transmission electron micrographs of unstained frozen hydrated
	specimens. This is a challenging computational problem because these

  abstract = {Accurate maps of large macromolecular complexes can be calculated
	from cryo-electron micrographs of non-crystalline specimens to resolutions
	of about 10 A. A method to dock the atomic structures of domains
	solved by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance into
	cryo-EM maps is presented. Domains can be docked independently into
	large complexes without prior definition of the boundaries. No special
	symmetry is assumed and the procedure is suitable for general application
	to almost any system where a cryo-EM map (at 15 A resolution or better)
	of a complex has been obtained and the atomic structures of the components
	are available. This is achieved through use of a real-space density-matching
	procedure based on local correlation. A complete asymmetric unit
	search correlating a density object derived from the atomic coordinates
	and the density of the EM map is performed. The correlation coefficient
	is calculated locally in real space using only values of the search
	object and corresponding samples extracted from the EM map which
	are under the 'footprint' of the positioned search object. The procedure
	has been demonstrated by docking the domains of GroEL from the crystal
	structure into a cryo-EM map Fourier filtered to 12 or 15 A resolution.
	The correct positions were found without applying any additional
	constraints. A model of the oligomer built from the docked domains

	the number of available PPI inhibitor databases and the limited number
	of 3D structures available for proteins, docking and scoring methods
	play a major role in designing PPI inhibitors as well as stabilizers.
	Docking methods are used in the design of PPI inhibitors at several
	stages of finding a lead compound, including modeling the protein
	complex, screening for hot spots on the protein-protein interaction
	interface and screening small molecules or peptides that bind to
	the PPI interface. There are three major challenges to the use of
	docking on the relatively flat surfaces of PPI. In this review we
	will provide some examples of the use of docking in PPI inhibitor
	design as well as its limitations. The combination of experimental
	and docking methods with improved scoring function has thus far resulted
	in few success stories of PPI inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.

	We developed fast open-source x-ray scattering (FoXS) for profile

	models the first hydration layer of the molecule. For assessing the
	accuracy of the modeled hydration layer, we performed contrast variation

	can accurately represent density changes of this layer. The hydration
	layer model was also compared with a SAXS profile calculated for
	the explicit water molecules in the high-resolution structures of
	glucose isomerase and lysozyme. We tested FoXS on eleven protein,
	one DNA, and two RNA structures, revealing superior accuracy and
	speed versus CRYSOL, AquaSAXS, the Zernike polynomials-based method,

  abstract = {Protein-peptide interactions are vital for the cell. They mediate,
	inhibit or serve as structural components in nearly 40\% of all macromolecular
	interactions, and are often associated with diseases, making them
	interesting leads for protein drug design. In recent years, large-scale
	technologies have enabled exhaustive studies on the peptide recognition
	preferences for a number of peptide-binding domain families. Yet,
	the paucity of data regarding their molecular binding mechanisms
	together with their inherent flexibility makes the structural prediction
	of protein-peptide interactions very challenging. This leaves flexible
	docking as one of the few amenable computational techniques to model
	these complexes. We present here an ensemble, flexible protein-peptide
	docking protocol that combines conformational selection and induced
	fit mechanisms. Starting from an ensemble of three peptide conformations
	(extended, a-helix, polyproline-II), flexible docking with HADDOCK
	generates 79.4\% of high quality models for bound/unbound and 69.4\%
	for unbound/unbound docking when tested against the largest protein-peptide
	complexes benchmark dataset available to date. Conformational selection
	at the rigid-body docking stage successfully recovers the most relevant
	conformation for a given protein-peptide complex and the subsequent
	flexible refinement further improves the interface by up to 4.5 Ã
	interface RMSD. Cluster-based scoring of the models results in a
	selection of near-native solutions in the top three for â¼75\% of
	the successfully predicted cases. This unified conformational selection
	and induced fit approach to protein-peptide docking should open the
	route to the modeling of challenging systems such as disorder-order
	transitions taking place upon binding, significantly expanding the

	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain
	level of integration. Although we focus on protein-protein docking,

	problems, including protein structure prediction and the docking

  abstract = {The protein-protein docking problem is one of the focal points of
	activity in computational biophysics and structural biology. The
	three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally,
	is more difficult to determine experimentally than the structure
	of an individual protein. Adequate computational techniques to model
	protein interactions are important because of the growing number
	of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural
	genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein
	interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein
	docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given
	the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking
	methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity
	at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution,
	experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein
	structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the
	focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures.
	Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between
	unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the
	interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed
	for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing
	number of docking developers is engaged in the community-wide assessments
	of predictive methodologies. The development of more powerful and
	adequate docking approaches is facilitated by rapidly expanding information
	and data resources, growing computational capabilities, and a deeper
	understanding of the fundamental principles of protein interactions.},

	with signal sequences and undergo a series of distinct conformational
	changes, which ensures accurate timing and fidelity of protein targeting.
	Initial recruitment of the SRP receptor FtsY to the SRP-RNC complex
	results in GTP-independent binding of the SRP-FtsY GTPases at the
	SRP RNA tetraloop. In the presence of GTP, a closed state is adopted
	by the SRP-FtsY complex. The cryo-EM structure of the closed state
	reveals an ordered SRP RNA and SRP M domain with a signal sequence-bound.
	Van der Waals interactions between the finger loop and ribosomal
	protein L24 lead to a constricted signal sequence-binding pocket
	possibly preventing premature release of the signal sequence. Conserved
	M-domain residues contact ribosomal RNA helices 24 and 59. The SRP-FtsY

  abstract = {The 2H2 monoclonal antibody recognizes the precursor peptide on immature
	dengue virus and might therefore be a useful tool for investigating
	the conformational change that occurs when the immature virus enters
	an acidic environment. During dengue virus maturation, spiky, immature,
	noninfectious virions change their structure to form smooth-surfaced
	particles in the slightly acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network,
	thereby allowing cellular furin to cleave the precursor-membrane
	proteins. The dengue virions become fully infectious when they release
	the cleaved precursor peptide upon reaching the neutral-pH environment
	of the extracellular space. Here we report on the cryo-electron microscopy
	structures of the immature virus complexed with the 2H2 antigen binding
	fragments (Fab) at different concentrations and under various pH
	conditions. At neutral pH and a high concentration of Fab molecules,
	three Fab molecules bind to three precursor-membrane proteins on
	each spike of the immature virus. However, at a low concentration
	of Fab molecules and pH 7.0, only two Fab molecules bind to each
	spike. Changing to a slightly acidic pH caused no detectable change
	of structure for the sample with a high Fab concentration but caused
	severe structural damage to the low-concentration sample. Therefore,
	the 2H2 Fab inhibits the maturation process of immature dengue virus
	when Fab molecules are present at a high concentration, because the
	three Fab molecules on each spike hold the precursor-membrane molecules
	together, thereby inhibiting the normal conformational change that
	occurs during maturation.},

  abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy of "single particles" is a powerful method
	to analyze structures of large macromolecular assemblies that are
	not amenable to investigation by traditional X-ray crystallographic
	methods. A key step in these studies is to obtain atomic interpretations
	of multiprotein complexes by fitting atomic structures of individual
	components into maps obtained from electron microscopic data. Here,
	we report the use of a "core-weighting" method, combined with a grid-threading
	Monte Carlo (GTMC) approach for this purpose. The "core" of an individual
	structure is defined to represent the part where the density distribution
	is least likely to be altered by other components that comprise the
	macromolecular assembly of interest. The performance of the method
	has been evaluated by its ability to determine the correct fit of
	(i) the alpha-chain of the T-cell receptor variable domain into a
	simulated map of the alphabeta complex at resolutions between 5 and
	40 A, and (ii) the E2 catalytic domain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
	into an experimentally determined map, at 14 A resolution, of the
	icosahedral complex formed by 60 copies of this enzyme. Using the
	X-ray structures of the two test cases as references, we demonstrate
	that, in contrast to more traditional methods, the combination of
	the core-weighting method and the grid-threading Monte Carlo approach
	can identify the correct fit reliably and rapidly from the low-resolution
	maps that are typical of structures determined with the use of single-particle
	electron microscopy.},

  abstract = {Single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) typically produces
	density maps of macromolecular assemblies at intermediate to low
	resolution (approximately 5-30 A). By fitting high-resolution structures
	of assembly components into these maps, pseudo-atomic models can
	be obtained. Optimizing the quality-of-fit of all components simultaneously
	is challenging due to the large search space that makes the exhaustive
	search over all possible component configurations computationally
	unfeasible.We developed an efficient mathematical programming algorithm
	that simultaneously fits all component structures into an assembly
	density map. The fitting is formulated as a point set matching problem
	involving several point sets that represent component and assembly
	densities at a reduced complexity level. In contrast to other point
	matching algorithms, our algorithm is able to match multiple point
	sets simultaneously and not only based on their geometrical equivalence,
	but also based on the similarity of the density in the immediate
	point neighborhood. In addition, we present an efficient refinement
	method based on the Iterative Closest Point registration algorithm.
	The integer quadratic programming method generates an assembly configuration
	in a few seconds. This efficiency allows the generation of an ensemble
	of candidate solutions that can be assessed by an independent scoring
	function. We benchmarked the method using simulated density maps
	of 11 protein assemblies at 20 A, and an experimental cryoEM map
	at 23.5 A resolution. Our method was able to generate assembly structures
	with root-mean-square errors <6.5 A, which have been further reduced
	to <1.8 A by the local refinement procedure.The program is available
	upon request as a Matlab code package.Supplementary data are available
