  abstract = {The determination of macromolecular structure by crystallography involves
	fitting atomic models to the observed diffraction data. The traditional
	measure of the quality of this fit, and presumably the accuracy of
	the model, is the R value. Despite stereochemical restraints, it
	is possible to overfit or 'misfit' the diffraction data: an incorrect
	model can be refined to fairly good R values as several recent examples
	have shown. Here I propose a reliable and unbiased indicator of the
	accuracy of such models. By analogy with the cross-validation method
	of testing statistical models I define a statistical quantity (R(free)
	(T) that measures the agreement between observed and computed structure
	factor amplitudes for a 'test' set of reflections that is omitted
	in the modelling and refinement process. As examples show, there
	is a high correlation between R(free) (T) and the accuracy of the
	atomic model phases. This is useful because experimental phase information
	is usually inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable. I expect that R(free)
	(T) will provide a measure of the information content of recently
	proposed models of thermal motion and disorder, time-averaging and
	bulk solvent.},

  abstract = {Single-structure models derived from X-ray data do not adequately
	account for the inherent, functionally important dynamics of protein
	molecules. We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged
	refinement, where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics
	(MD) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying
	overall translation-libration-screw (TLS) model. Modeling of 20 protein
	datasets at 1.1-3.1 Å resolution reduced cross-validated R(free)
	values by 0.3-4.9\%, indicating that ensemble models fit the X-ray
	data better than single structures. The ensembles revealed that,
	while most proteins display a well-ordered core, some proteins exhibit
	a 'molten core' likely supporting functionally important dynamics
	in ligand binding, enzyme activity and protomer assembly. Order-disorder
	changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation
	for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering
	specific core residues. Thus, ensemble refinement extracts dynamical
	details from the X-ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding
	of structure-dynamics-function relationships.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00311.001.},

  abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on
	X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100 K).
	The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional
	interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures
	minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast,
	here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural
	ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30
	different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density
	sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found
	that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions
	of more than 35\% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary
	for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an
	allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution
	by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic,
	electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural
	databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique

  abstract = {Chemical cross-links identified by mass spectrometry generate distance

	has become mature and robust enough to shift the focus to the question
	of how these distance restraints can be best integrated into molecular

	distance restraints generated by chemical cross-linking and mass
	spectrometry into ROSETTA protocols for comparative and de novo modeling
	and protein-protein docking. We demonstrate that the cross-link validation
	and visualization software Xwalk facilitates successful cross-link
	data integration. Besides the protocols we introduce XLdb, a database
	of chemical cross-links from 14 different publications with 506 intra-protein
	and 62 inter-protein cross-links, where each cross-link can be mapped
	on an experimental structure from the Protein Data Bank. Finally,
	we demonstrate on a protein-protein docking reference data set the
	impact of virtual cross-links on protein docking calculations and
	show that an inter-protein cross-link can reduce on average the RMSD
	of a docking prediction by 5.0 Å. The methods and results presented
	here provide guidelines for the effective integration of chemical
	cross-link data in molecular modeling calculations and should advance
	the structural analysis of particularly large and transient protein

	followed by the MS identification of the cross-linked peptides has
	found increasingly widespread use in recent years. Thus far, such
	analyses have used almost exclusively homobifunctional, amine-reactive
	cross-linking reagents. Here we report the development and application
	of an orthogonal cross-linking chemistry specific for carboxyl groups.
	Chemical cross-linking of acidic residues is achieved using homobifunctional
	dihydrazides as cross-linking reagents and a coupling chemistry at
	neutral pH that is compatible with the structural integrity of most
	protein complexes. In addition to cross-links formed through insertion
	of the dihydrazides with different spacer lengths, zero-length cross-link
	products are also obtained, thereby providing additional structural
	information. We demonstrate the application of the reaction and the
	MS identification of the resulting cross-linked peptides for the
	chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the 26S proteasome. The results indicate
	that the targeting of acidic residues for cross-linking provides
	distance restraints that are complementary and orthogonal to those

	such a characterization may be achieved by small angle x-ray scattering

	and accurate profile computation from molecular structures is needed.
	We developed fast open-source x-ray scattering (FoXS) for profile
	computation. To match the experimental profile within the experimental
	noise, FoXS explicitly computes all interatomic distances and implicitly
	models the first hydration layer of the molecule. For assessing the
	accuracy of the modeled hydration layer, we performed contrast variation
	experiments for glucose isomerase and lysozyme, and found that FoXS
	can accurately represent density changes of this layer. The hydration
	layer model was also compared with a SAXS profile calculated for
	the explicit water molecules in the high-resolution structures of
	glucose isomerase and lysozyme. We tested FoXS on eleven protein,
	one DNA, and two RNA structures, revealing superior accuracy and
	speed versus CRYSOL, AquaSAXS, the Zernike polynomials-based method,
	and Fast-SAXS-pro. In addition, we demonstrated a significant correlation
	of the SAXS score with the accuracy of a structural model. Moreover,
	FoXS utility for analyzing heterogeneous samples was demonstrated
	for intrinsically flexible XLF-XRCC4 filaments and Ligase III-DNA
	complex. FoXS is extensively used as a standalone web server as a
	component of integrative structure determination by programs IMP,

	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain

  abstract = {The fitting of high-resolution structures into low-resolution densities
	obtained from techniques such as electron microscopy or small-angle
	X-ray scattering can yield powerful new insights. While several algorithms
	for achieving optimal fits have recently been developed, relatively
	little effort has been devoted to developing objective measures for
	judging the quality of the resulting fits, in particular with regard
	to the danger of overfitting. Here, a general method is presented
	for obtaining confidence intervals for atomic coordinates resulting
	from fitting of atomic resolution domain structures into low-resolution
	densities using well established statistical tools. It is demonstrated
	that the resulting confidence intervals are sufficiently accurate
	to allow meaningful statistical tests and to provide tools for detecting
	potential overfitting.},

  abstract = {We present an updated and integrated version of our widely used protein-protein
	docking and binding affinity benchmarks. The benchmarks consist of
	non-redundant, high quality structures of protein-protein complexes
	along with the unbound structures of their components. Fifty-five
	new complexes were added to the docking benchmark, 35 of which have
	experimentally-measured binding affinities. These updated docking
	and affinity benchmarks now contain 230 and 179 entries, respectively.
	In particular, the number of antibody-antigen complexes has increased
	significantly, by 67\% and 74\% in the docking and affinity benchmarks,
	respectively. We tested previously developed docking and affinity
	prediction algorithms on the new cases. Considering only the top
	ten docking predictions per benchmark case, a prediction accuracy
	of 38\% is achieved on all 55 cases, and up to 50\% for the 32 rigid-body
	cases only. Predicted affinity scores are found to correlate with
	experimental binding energies up to r=0.52 overall, and r=0.72 for
	the rigid complexes.},
