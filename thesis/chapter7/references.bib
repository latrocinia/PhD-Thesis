  abstract = {Chemical cross-links identified by mass spectrometry generate distance
	restraints that reveal low-resolution structural information on proteins
	and protein complexes. The technology to reliably generate such data
	has become mature and robust enough to shift the focus to the question
	of how these distance restraints can be best integrated into molecular
	modeling calculations. Here, we introduce three workflows for incorporating
	distance restraints generated by chemical cross-linking and mass
	spectrometry into ROSETTA protocols for comparative and de novo modeling
	and protein-protein docking. We demonstrate that the cross-link validation
	and visualization software Xwalk facilitates successful cross-link
	data integration. Besides the protocols we introduce XLdb, a database
	of chemical cross-links from 14 different publications with 506 intra-protein
	and 62 inter-protein cross-links, where each cross-link can be mapped
	on an experimental structure from the Protein Data Bank. Finally,
	we demonstrate on a protein-protein docking reference data set the
	impact of virtual cross-links on protein docking calculations and
	show that an inter-protein cross-link can reduce on average the RMSD
	of a docking prediction by 5.0 Å. The methods and results presented
	here provide guidelines for the effective integration of chemical
	cross-link data in molecular modeling calculations and should advance
	the structural analysis of particularly large and transient protein
	complexes via hybrid structural biology methods.},

  abstract = {The study of proteins and protein complexes using chemical cross-linking
	followed by the MS identification of the cross-linked peptides has
	found increasingly widespread use in recent years. Thus far, such
	analyses have used almost exclusively homobifunctional, amine-reactive
	cross-linking reagents. Here we report the development and application
	of an orthogonal cross-linking chemistry specific for carboxyl groups.
	Chemical cross-linking of acidic residues is achieved using homobifunctional
	dihydrazides as cross-linking reagents and a coupling chemistry at
	neutral pH that is compatible with the structural integrity of most
	protein complexes. In addition to cross-links formed through insertion
	of the dihydrazides with different spacer lengths, zero-length cross-link
	products are also obtained, thereby providing additional structural
	information. We demonstrate the application of the reaction and the
	MS identification of the resulting cross-linked peptides for the
	chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the 26S proteasome. The results indicate
	that the targeting of acidic residues for cross-linking provides
	distance restraints that are complementary and orthogonal to those
	obtained from lysine cross-linking, thereby expanding the yield of
	structural information that can be obtained from cross-linking studies
	and used in hybrid modeling approaches.},

  abstract = {Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with X-rays or neutrons
	provide a comprehensive, resolution-limited observation of the thermodynamic
	state. However, methods for evaluating mass and validating SAS-based
	models and resolution have been inadequate. Here we define the volume
	of correlation, Vc, a SAS invariant derived from the scattered intensities
	that is specific to the structural state of the particle, but independent
	of concentration and the requirements of a compact, folded particle.
	We show that Vc defines a ratio, QR, that determines the molecular
	mass of proteins or RNA ranging from 10 to 1,000 kilodaltons. Furthermore,
	we propose a statistically robust method for assessing model-data
	agreements (χ(2)free) akin to cross-validation. Our approach prevents
	over-fitting of the SAS data and can be used with a newly defined
	metric, RSAS, for quantitative evaluation of resolution. Together,
	these metrics (Vc, QR, χ(2)free and RSAS) provide analytical tools
	for unbiased and accurate macromolecular structural characterizations
	in solution.},

	data has been incorporated into modelling algorithms it will quickly
	become an indispensable companion of protein and protein complex
	modelling and a corner-stone of integrated structural biology.},

  abstract = {Most structure prediction algorithms consist of initial sampling of
	the conformational space, followed by rescoring and possibly refinement
	of a number of selected structures. Here we focus on protein docking,
	and show that while decoupling sampling and scoring facilitates method
	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain
	level of integration. Although we focus on protein-protein docking,
	our observations most likely also apply to other conformational search
	problems, including protein structure prediction and the docking
	of small molecules to proteins.},
