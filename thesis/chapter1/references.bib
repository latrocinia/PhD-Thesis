  abstract = {To understand the workings of a living cell, we need to know the architectures
	of its macromolecular assemblies. Here we show how proteomic data
	can be used to determine such structures. The process involves the
	collection of sufficient and diverse high-quality data, translation
	of these data into spatial restraints, and an optimization that uses
	the restraints to generate an ensemble of structures consistent with
	the data. Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural
	map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model
	system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic
	barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast
	is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented
	in an accompanying paper, reveals the configuration of the proteins
	in the NPC, providing insights into its evolution and architectural
	principles. The present approach should be applicable to many other
	macromolecular assemblies.},

	for the subsequent docking and refinement stages. In the docking

	The progress in the development of template-based docking and the
	vast experience in template-based modeling of individual proteins
	show that, generally, such approaches are more reliable than the
	free modeling. The key aspect of this modeling paradigm is the availability
	of the templates. The current common perception is that due to the
	difficulties in experimental structure determination of protein-protein
	complexes, the pool of docking templates is insignificant, and thus
	a broad application of template-based docking is possible only at
	some future time. The results of our large scale, systematic study
	show that, surprisingly, in spite of the limited number of protein-protein
	complexes in the Protein Data Bank, docking templates can be found
	for complexes representing almost all the known protein-protein interactions,
	provided the components themselves have a known structure or can
	be homology-built. About one-third of the templates are of good quality

  abstract = {Protein-protein binding is one of the critical events in biology,
	and knowledge of proteic complexes three-dimensional structures is
	of fundamental importance for the biochemical study of pharmacologic
	compounds. In the past two decades there was an emergence of a large
	variety of algorithms designed to predict the structures of protein-protein
	complexes--a procedure named docking. Computational methods, if accurate
	and reliable, could play an important role, both to infer functional
	properties and to guide new experiments. Despite the outstanding
	progress of the methodologies developed in this area, a few problems
	still prevent protein-protein docking to be a widespread practice
	in the structural study of proteins. In this review we focus our
	attention on the principles that govern docking, namely the algorithms
	used for searching and scoring, which are usually referred as the
	docking problem. We also focus our attention on the use of a flexible
	description of the proteins under study and the use of biological
	information as the localization of the hot spots, the important residues
	for protein-protein binding. The most common docking softwares are
	described too.},

	PPI inhibition for designing drug-like molecules is a new area that

	the number of available PPI inhibitor databases and the limited number
	of 3D structures available for proteins, docking and scoring methods
	play a major role in designing PPI inhibitors as well as stabilizers.
	Docking methods are used in the design of PPI inhibitors at several

	interface and screening small molecules or peptides that bind to
	the PPI interface. There are three major challenges to the use of

	will provide some examples of the use of docking in PPI inhibitor
	design as well as its limitations. The combination of experimental
	and docking methods with improved scoring function has thus far resulted

	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain

	three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally,

	protein interactions are important because of the growing number
	of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural
	genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein
	interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein
	docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given
	the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking
	methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity
	at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution,
	experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein
	structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the
	focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures.
	Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between
	unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the
	interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed
	for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing

	efficient treatment of conformational changes especially of the protein
	backbone during docking remains a challenge. New promising approaches
	of flexible refinement, ensemble docking and explicit inclusion of
	flexibility during the entire docking process have been developed.
	A significant fraction of known protein-protein interactions can
	be modeled based on homology to known protein-protein complexes which
	in many cases also requires efficient flexible refinement to provide
	accurate structural models.},
