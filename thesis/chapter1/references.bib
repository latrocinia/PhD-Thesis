  Abstract                 = {To understand the workings of a living cell, we need to know the architectures of its macromolecular assemblies. Here we show how proteomic data can be used to determine such structures. The process involves the collection of sufficient and diverse high-quality data, translation of these data into spatial restraints, and an optimization that uses the restraints to generate an ensemble of structures consistent with the data. Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented in an accompanying paper, reveals the configuration of the proteins in the NPC, providing insights into its evolution and architectural principles. The present approach should be applicable to many other macromolecular assemblies.},

Here we describe the background and the principles of existing flexible protein-protein docking methods, focusing on the algorithms and their rational. We describe how protein flexibility is treated in different stages of the docking process: in the preprocessing stage, rigid and flexible parts are identified and their possible conformations are modeled. This preprocessing provides information for the subsequent docking and refinement stages. In the docking stage, an ensemble of pre-generated conformations or the identified rigid domains may be docked separately. In the refinement stage, small-scale movements of the backbone and side-chains are modeled and the binding orientation is improved by rigid-body adjustments. For clarity of presentation, we divide the different methods into categories. This should allow the reader to focus on the most suitable method for a particular docking problem.},

Combined, these advances yield density maps with sufficient detail to deduce the atomic structure for a range of specimens.

  Abstract                 = {Novel discoveries in molecular disease pathways within the cell, combined with increasing information regarding protein binding partners has lead to a new approach in drug discovery. There is interest in designing drugs to modulate protein-protein interactions as opposed to solely targeting the catalytic active site within a single enzyme or protein. There are many challenges in this new approach to drug discovery, particularly since the protein-protein interface has a larger surface area, can comprise a discontinuous epitope, and is more amorphous and less well defined than the typical drug design target, a small contained enzyme-binding pocket. Computational methods to predict modes of protein-protein interaction, as well as protein interface hot spots, have garnered significant interest, in order to facilitate the development of drugs to successfully disrupt and inhibit protein-protein interactions. This review summarizes some current methods available for computational protein-protein docking, as well as tabulating some examples of the successful design of antagonists and small molecule inhibitors for protein-protein interactions. Several of these drugs are now beginning to appear in the clinic.},

Therefore, current research in biomedicine is starting to focus on protein interaction networks. A detailed structural knowledge of these interactions at molecular level will be necessary for drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions. The challenge from a structural biology point of view is determining the structure of the specific complex formed upon interaction of two or several proteins, and/or locating the surface residues involved in the interaction and identify which of them are the most important ones for binding (hot-spots). In this line, an increasing number of computer tools are available to complement experimental efforts. Docking algorithms can achieve successful predictive rates in many complexes, as shown in the community assessment experiment CAPRI, and have already been applied to a variety of cases of biomedical interest. On the other side, many methods for interface and hotspot prediction have been reported, based on a variety of evolutionary, geometrical and physico-chemical parameters. Computer predictions are reaching a significant level of maturity, and can be very useful to guide experiments and suggest mutations, or to provide a mechanistic framework to the experimental results on a given interaction. We will review here existing computer approaches for proteinprotein docking, interface prediction and hot-spot identification, with focus to drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions.},

Building on earlier work, we show that analysis of correlated evolutionary sequence changes across proteins identifies residues that are close in space with sufficient accuracy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate prediction performance in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure, predict protein-protein contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and demonstrate how evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the current growth of sequences, we expect that the method can be generalized to genome-wide elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution structural information is needed in order to unveil the underlying mechanistic of biomolecular function. Due to the technical limitations or the nature of the underlying complexes, acquiring atomic resolution information is difficult for many challenging systems, while, often, low-resolution biochemical or biophysical data can still be obtained. To make best use of all the available information and shed light on these challenging systems, integrative computational tools are required that can judiciously combine and accurately translate sparse experimental data into structural information. In this review we discuss the current state of integrative approaches, the challenges they are confronting and the advances made regarding those challenges. Recent developments are underpinned by noteworthy application examples taken from the literature. Within this context, we also position our data-driven docking approach, HADDOCK that can integrate a variety of information sources to drive the modeling of biomolecular complexes. Only a synergistic combination of experiment and modeling will allow us to tackle the challenges of adding the structural dimension to interactomes, shed "atomic" light onto molecular processes and understand the underlying mechanistic of biomolecular function. The current state of integrative approaches indicates that they are poised to take those challenges.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional approaches to protein-protein docking sample the binding modes with no regard to similar experimentally determined structures (templates) of protein-protein complexes. Emerging template-based docking approaches utilize such similar complexes to determine the docking predictions. The docking problem assumes the knowledge of the participating proteins' structures. Thus, it provides the possibility of aligning the structures of the proteins and the template complexes. The progress in the development of template-based docking and the vast experience in template-based modeling of individual proteins show that, generally, such approaches are more reliable than the free modeling. The key aspect of this modeling paradigm is the availability of the templates. The current common perception is that due to the difficulties in experimental structure determination of protein-protein complexes, the pool of docking templates is insignificant, and thus a broad application of template-based docking is possible only at some future time. The results of our large scale, systematic study show that, surprisingly, in spite of the limited number of protein-protein complexes in the Protein Data Bank, docking templates can be found for complexes representing almost all the known protein-protein interactions, provided the components themselves have a known structure or can be homology-built. About one-third of the templates are of good quality when they are compared to experimental structures in test sets extracted from the Protein Data Bank and would be useful starting points in modeling the complexes. This finding dramatically expands our ability to model protein interactions, and has far-reaching implications for the protein docking field in general.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

These developments promise to increase the speed and extent of automation, and to improve the resolutions that may be achieved, making this technology useful to determine a wide variety of biological structures. Additionally, established modalities for structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are being routinely integrated with cryo-EM density maps to achieve atomic-resolution models of complex, dynamic molecular assemblies. In this review, which is directed towards readers who are not experts in cryo-EM methodology, we provide an overview of emerging themes in the application of this technology to investigate diverse questions in biology and medicine. We discuss the ways in which these methods are being used to study structures of macromolecular assemblies that range in size from whole cells to small proteins. Finally, we include a description of how the structural information obtained by cryo-EM is deposited and archived in a publicly accessible database.},

Computational methods, if accurate and reliable, could play an important role, both to infer functional properties and to guide new experiments. Despite the outstanding progress of the methodologies developed in this area, a few problems still prevent protein-protein docking to be a widespread practice in the structural study of proteins. In this review we focus our attention on the principles that govern docking, namely the algorithms used for searching and scoring, which are usually referred as the docking problem. We also focus our attention on the use of a flexible description of the proteins under study and the use of biological information as the localization of the hot spots, the important residues for protein-protein binding.

Our ability to understand these interactions and their role in both health and disease is tied to our knowledge of the 3D atomic structure of the interacting partners and their complexes. Despite advances in experimental method of structure determination, the majority of known protein interactions are still missing an atomic structure. High-resolution methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy struggle with the high-throughput demand, while low-resolution techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy or small-angle X-ray scattering provide data that are too coarse. Computational structure prediction of protein complexes, or docking, was first developed to complement experimental research and has since blossomed into an independent and lively field of research. Its most successful products are hybrid approaches that combine powerful algorithms with experimental data from various sources to generate high-resolution models of protein complexes. This minireview introduces the concept of docking and docking with the help of experimental data, compares and contrasts the available integrative docking methods, and provides a guide for the experimental researcher for what types of data and which particular software can be used to model a protein complex.},

  Abstract                 = {Blocking protein-protein interactions (PPI) using small molecules or peptides modulates biochemical pathways and has therapeutic significance. PPI inhibition for designing drug-like molecules is a new area that has been explored extensively during the last decade. Considering the number of available PPI inhibitor databases and the limited number of 3D structures available for proteins, docking and scoring methods play a major role in designing PPI inhibitors as well as stabilizers. Docking methods are used in the design of PPI inhibitors at several stages of finding a lead compound, including modeling the protein complex, screening for hot spots on the protein-protein interaction interface and screening small molecules or peptides that bind to the PPI interface. There are three major challenges to the use of docking on the relatively flat surfaces of PPI. In this review we will provide some examples of the use of docking in PPI inhibitor design as well as its limitations. The combination of experimental and docking methods with improved scoring function has thus far resulted in few success stories of PPI inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Docking algorithms used for PPI are in the early stages, however, and as more data are available docking will become a highly promising area in the design of PPI inhibitors or stabilizers.},

In the first stage, uncertainty originates from data that are sparse, noisy, ambiguous, or derived from heterogeneous samples. In the second stage, uncertainty can originate from a representation that is too coarse for the available information or a scoring function that does not accurately capture the information. In the third stage, the major source of uncertainty is insufficient sampling. In the fourth stage, clustering, cross-validation, and other methods are used to estimate the precision and accuracy of the models and information.},

In this manuscript, we critically review some of the most recent developments in the field of structural bioinformatics applied to the modeling of protein interactions and complexes, from large macromolecular machines to domain-domain and peptide-mediated interactions. In particular, we place a special emphasis on those methods that can be applied in a proteome-wide manner, and discuss how they will help in the ultimate objective of building 3D interactome networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Most structure prediction algorithms consist of initial sampling of the conformational space, followed by rescoring and possibly refinement of a number of selected structures. Here we focus on protein docking, and show that while decoupling sampling and scoring facilitates method development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction, we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others for method development. We then describe three case studies showing that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain level of integration. Although we focus on protein-protein docking, our observations most likely also apply to other conformational search problems, including protein structure prediction and the docking of small molecules to proteins.},

Although these classes of methods require very different amounts of information in addition to the structures of component proteins, they all share the same four computational steps: firstly, simplified and/or rigid body search; secondly, selecting the region(s) of interest; thirdly, refinement of docked structures; and fourthly, selecting the best models.

  Abstract                 = {The protein-protein docking problem is one of the focal points of activity in computational biophysics and structural biology. The three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally, is more difficult to determine experimentally than the structure of an individual protein. Adequate computational techniques to model protein interactions are important because of the growing number of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution, experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures. Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing number of docking developers is engaged in the community-wide assessments of predictive methodologies. The development of more powerful and adequate docking approaches is facilitated by rapidly expanding information and data resources, growing computational capabilities, and a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of protein interactions.},

These studies discovered small molecules that bind with drug-like potencies to 'hotspots' on the contact surfaces involved in protein-protein interactions. Remarkably, these small molecules bind deeper within the contact surface of the target protein, and bind with much higher efficiencies, than do the contact atoms of the natural protein partner. Some of these small molecules are now making their way through clinical trials, so this high-hanging fruit might not be far out of reach.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional structures of only a small fraction of known protein-protein complexes are currently known. Meanwhile, computational methods are of increasing importance to provide structural models for known protein-protein interactions. Current protein-protein docking methods are often successful if experimentally determined partner proteins undergo little conformational changes upon binding. However, the realistic and computationally efficient treatment of conformational changes especially of the protein backbone during docking remains a challenge. New promising approaches of flexible refinement, ensemble docking and explicit inclusion of flexibility during the entire docking process have been developed. A significant fraction of known protein-protein interactions can be modeled based on homology to known protein-protein complexes which in many cases also requires efficient flexible refinement to provide accurate structural models.},
