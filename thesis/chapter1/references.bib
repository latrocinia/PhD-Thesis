  abstract = {The development of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in protein NMR
	spectroscopy, over a decade ago, has become a useful and almost routine
	tool for accurate protein solution structure determination. RDCs
	provide orientation information of magnetic dipole-dipole interaction
	vectors within a common reference frame. Its measurement requires
	a nonisotropic orientation, through a direct or indirect magnetic
	field alignment, of the protein in solution. There has been recent
	progress in the developments of alignment methods to allow the measurement
	of RDC and of methods to analyze the resulting data. In this chapter
	we briefly go through the mathematical expressions for the RDC and
	common descriptions of the alignment tensor, which may be represented
	using either Saupe order or the principal order matrix. Then we review
	the latest developments in alignment media. In particular we looked
	at the lipid-compatible media that allow the measurement of RDCs
	for membrane proteins. Other methods including conservative surface
	residue mutation have been invented to obtain up to five orthogonal
	alignment tensors that provide a potential for de novo structure
	and dynamics study using RDCs exclusively. We then discuss approximations
	assumed in RDC interpretations and different views on dynamics uncovered
	from the RDC method. In addition to routine usage of RDCs in refining
	a single structure, novel applications such as ensemble refinement
	against RDCs have been implemented to represent protein structure
	and dynamics in solution. The RDC application also extends to the
	study of protein-substrate interaction as well as to solving quaternary
	structure of oligomer in equilibrium with a monomer, opening an avenue
	for RDCs in high-order protein structure determination.},

	establishing transcriptional repression of specific genes by tri-methylating
	Lysine 27 of histone H3, a process mediated by cofactors such as
	AEBP2. In spite of its biological importance, little is known about
	PRC2 architecture and subunit organization. Here, we present the
	first three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the human
	PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor AEBP2. Using a novel internal
	protein tagging-method, in combination with isotopic chemical cross-linking
	and mass spectrometry, we have localized all the PRC2 subunits and
	their functional domains and generated a detailed map of interactions.
	The position and stabilization effect of AEBP2 suggests an allosteric
	role of this cofactor in regulating gene silencing. Regions in PRC2
	that interact with modified histone tails are localized near the

  abstract = {Over the last years, large scale proteomics studies have generated
	a wealth of information of biomolecular complexes. Adding the structural
	dimension to the resulting interactomes represents a major challenge
	that classical structural experimental methods alone will have difficulties
	to confront. To meet this challenge, complementary modeling techniques
	such as docking are thus needed. Among the current docking methods,
	HADDOCK (High Ambiguity-Driven DOCKing) distinguishes itself from
	others by the use of experimental and/or bioinformatics data to drive
	the modeling process and has shown a strong performance in the critical
	assessment of prediction of interactions (CAPRI), a blind experiment
	for the prediction of interactions. Although most docking programs
	are limited to binary complexes, HADDOCK can deal with multiple molecules
	(up to six), a capability that will be required to build large macromolecular
	assemblies. We present here a novel web interface of HADDOCK that
	allows the user to dock up to six biomolecules simultaneously. This
	interface allows the inclusion of a large variety of both experimental
	and/or bioinformatics data and supports several types of cyclic and
	dihedral symmetries in the docking of multibody assemblies. The server
	was tested on a benchmark of six cases, containing five symmetric
	homo-oligomeric protein complexes and one symmetric protein-DNA complex.
	Our results reveal that, in the presence of either bioinformatics
	and/or experimental data, HADDOCK shows an excellent performance:
	in all cases, HADDOCK was able to generate good to high quality solutions
	and ranked them at the top, demonstrating its ability to model symmetric
	multicomponent assemblies. Docking methods can thus play an important
	role in adding the structural dimension to interactomes. However,
	although the current docking methodologies were successful for a
	vast range of cases, considering the variety and complexity of macromolecular
	assemblies, inclusion of some kind of experimental information (e.g.
	from mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryoelectron
	microscopy, etc.) will remain highly desirable to obtain reliable

	that can explicitly deal with water molecules during docking. Its
	solvated docking protocol starts from hydrated molecules, and a fraction
	of the interfacial water is subsequently removed from the docked

	is based on interfacial amino acid-water contact propensities derived
	from a dataset of high-resolution crystal structures of protein-protein

	and associated methodological aspects are illustrated through an
	application example. It is shown that, although docking results do
	not always improve when the solvated docking protocol is applied,
	scoring is improved and the positions of buried water molecules in

	The progress in the development of template-based docking and the
	vast experience in template-based modeling of individual proteins
	show that, generally, such approaches are more reliable than the
	free modeling. The key aspect of this modeling paradigm is the availability
	of the templates. The current common perception is that due to the
	difficulties in experimental structure determination of protein-protein
	complexes, the pool of docking templates is insignificant, and thus
	a broad application of template-based docking is possible only at
	some future time. The results of our large scale, systematic study
	show that, surprisingly, in spite of the limited number of protein-protein
	complexes in the Protein Data Bank, docking templates can be found
	for complexes representing almost all the known protein-protein interactions,
	provided the components themselves have a known structure or can
	be homology-built. About one-third of the templates are of good quality
	when they are compared to experimental structures in test sets extracted

  abstract = {To generate structures consistent with both the local and nonlocal
	interactions responsible for protein stability, 3 and 9 residue fragments
	of known structures with local sequences similar to the target sequence
	were assembled into complete tertiary structures using a Monte Carlo
	simulated annealing procedure (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997; 268:209-225).
	The scoring function used in the simulated annealing procedure consists
	of sequence-dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific
	pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and
	sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix
	and beta-strand packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets
	(Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82-95). For each of 21 small, ab
	initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the
	result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures
	submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately
	25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed
	through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc
	Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging:
	highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA
	with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full
	length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0
	A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and
	a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8
	A. These results suggest that ab initio methods may soon become useful
	for low-resolution structure prediction for proteins that lack a
	close homologue of known structure.},

	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain

	of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural
	genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein
	interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein
	docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given
	the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking
	methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity
	at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution,
	experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein
	structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the
	focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures.
	Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between

	the final assembly in which most waters have been expelled from the

	restraints (Meiler et al., J Biomol NMR 2000;16:245-252). The advantage

  abstract = {Intrinsic flexibility of DNA has hampered the development of efficient
	protein-DNA docking methods. In this study we extend HADDOCK (High
	Ambiguity Driven DOCKing) [C. Dominguez, R. Boelens and A. M. J.
	J. Bonvin (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 1731-1737] to explicitly
	deal with DNA flexibility. HADDOCK uses non-structural experimental
	data to drive the docking during a rigid-body energy minimization,
	and semi-flexible and water refinement stages. The latter allow for
	flexibility of all DNA nucleotides and the residues of the protein
	at the predicted interface. We evaluated our approach on the monomeric
	repressor-DNA complexes formed by bacteriophage 434 Cro, the Escherichia
	coli Lac headpiece and bacteriophage P22 Arc. Starting from unbound
	proteins and canonical B-DNA we correctly predict the correct spatial
	disposition of the complexes and the specific conformation of the
	DNA in the published complexes. This information is subsequently
	used to generate a library of pre-bent and twisted DNA structures
	that served as input for a second docking round. The resulting top
	ranking solutions exhibit high similarity to the published complexes
	in terms of root mean square deviations, intermolecular contacts
	and DNA conformation. Our two-stage docking method is thus able to
	successfully predict protein-DNA complexes from unbound constituents
	using non-structural experimental data to drive the docking.},

	For these, low-resolution and/or sparse data from a variety of sources
