  abstract = {To understand the workings of a living cell, we need to know the architectures
	of its macromolecular assemblies. Here we show how proteomic data
	can be used to determine such structures. The process involves the
	collection of sufficient and diverse high-quality data, translation
	of these data into spatial restraints, and an optimization that uses
	the restraints to generate an ensemble of structures consistent with
	the data. Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural
	map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model
	system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic
	barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast
	is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins. The resulting structure, presented
	in an accompanying paper, reveals the configuration of the proteins
	in the NPC, providing insights into its evolution and architectural
	principles. The present approach should be applicable to many other
	macromolecular assemblies.},

	for the subsequent docking and refinement stages. In the docking

  pages = {47--67},
  abstract = {The development of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in protein NMR
	spectroscopy, over a decade ago, has become a useful and almost routine
	tool for accurate protein solution structure determination. RDCs
	provide orientation information of magnetic dipole-dipole interaction
	vectors within a common reference frame. Its measurement requires
	a nonisotropic orientation, through a direct or indirect magnetic
	field alignment, of the protein in solution. There has been recent
	progress in the developments of alignment methods to allow the measurement
	of RDC and of methods to analyze the resulting data. In this chapter
	we briefly go through the mathematical expressions for the RDC and
	common descriptions of the alignment tensor, which may be represented
	using either Saupe order or the principal order matrix. Then we review
	the latest developments in alignment media. In particular we looked
	at the lipid-compatible media that allow the measurement of RDCs
	for membrane proteins. Other methods including conservative surface
	residue mutation have been invented to obtain up to five orthogonal
	alignment tensors that provide a potential for de novo structure
	and dynamics study using RDCs exclusively. We then discuss approximations
	assumed in RDC interpretations and different views on dynamics uncovered
	from the RDC method. In addition to routine usage of RDCs in refining
	a single structure, novel applications such as ensemble refinement
	against RDCs have been implemented to represent protein structure
	and dynamics in solution. The RDC application also extends to the
	study of protein-substrate interaction as well as to solving quaternary
	structure of oligomer in equilibrium with a monomer, opening an avenue
	for RDCs in high-order protein structure determination.},

	is starting to focus on protein interaction networks. A detailed
	structural knowledge of these interactions at molecular level will
	be necessary for drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions.
	The challenge from a structural biology point of view is determining
	the structure of the specific complex formed upon interaction of
	two or several proteins, and/or locating the surface residues involved
	in the interaction and identify which of them are the most important
	ones for binding (hot-spots). In this line, an increasing number
	of computer tools are available to complement experimental efforts.
	Docking algorithms can achieve successful predictive rates in many
	complexes, as shown in the community assessment experiment CAPRI,
	and have already been applied to a variety of cases of biomedical
	interest. On the other side, many methods for interface and hotspot
	prediction have been reported, based on a variety of evolutionary,
	geometrical and physico-chemical parameters. Computer predictions
	are reaching a significant level of maturity, and can be very useful
	to guide experiments and suggest mutations, or to provide a mechanistic
	framework to the experimental results on a given interaction. We
	will review here existing computer approaches for proteinprotein
	docking, interface prediction and hot-spot identification, with focus

  abstract = {Over the last years, large scale proteomics studies have generated
	a wealth of information of biomolecular complexes. Adding the structural
	dimension to the resulting interactomes represents a major challenge
	that classical structural experimental methods alone will have difficulties
	to confront. To meet this challenge, complementary modeling techniques
	such as docking are thus needed. Among the current docking methods,
	HADDOCK (High Ambiguity-Driven DOCKing) distinguishes itself from
	others by the use of experimental and/or bioinformatics data to drive
	the modeling process and has shown a strong performance in the critical
	assessment of prediction of interactions (CAPRI), a blind experiment
	for the prediction of interactions. Although most docking programs
	are limited to binary complexes, HADDOCK can deal with multiple molecules
	(up to six), a capability that will be required to build large macromolecular
	assemblies. We present here a novel web interface of HADDOCK that
	allows the user to dock up to six biomolecules simultaneously. This
	interface allows the inclusion of a large variety of both experimental
	and/or bioinformatics data and supports several types of cyclic and
	dihedral symmetries in the docking of multibody assemblies. The server
	was tested on a benchmark of six cases, containing five symmetric
	homo-oligomeric protein complexes and one symmetric protein-DNA complex.
	Our results reveal that, in the presence of either bioinformatics
	and/or experimental data, HADDOCK shows an excellent performance:
	in all cases, HADDOCK was able to generate good to high quality solutions
	and ranked them at the top, demonstrating its ability to model symmetric
	multicomponent assemblies. Docking methods can thus play an important
	role in adding the structural dimension to interactomes. However,
	although the current docking methodologies were successful for a
	vast range of cases, considering the variety and complexity of macromolecular
	assemblies, inclusion of some kind of experimental information (e.g.
	from mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryoelectron

	The progress in the development of template-based docking and the

	complexes, the pool of docking templates is insignificant, and thus
	a broad application of template-based docking is possible only at
	some future time. The results of our large scale, systematic study
	show that, surprisingly, in spite of the limited number of protein-protein
	complexes in the Protein Data Bank, docking templates can be found
	for complexes representing almost all the known protein-protein interactions,

	assemblies at molecular resolution. Recent developments in microscope

	cryo-EM density maps to achieve atomic-resolution models of complex,

	overview of emerging themes in the application of this technology
	to investigate diverse questions in biology and medicine. We discuss
	the ways in which these methods are being used to study structures

	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain

	problems, including protein structure prediction and the docking

	three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex, generally,

	protein interactions are important because of the growing number
	of known protein structures, particularly in the context of structural
	genomics. Docking offers tools for fundamental studies of protein
	interactions and provides a structural basis for drug design. Protein-protein
	docking is the prediction of the structure of the complex, given
	the structures of the individual proteins. In the heart of the docking
	methodology is the notion of steric and physicochemical complementarity
	at the protein-protein interface. Originally, mostly high-resolution,
	experimentally determined (primarily by x-ray crystallography) protein
	structures were considered for docking. However, more recently, the
	focus has been shifting toward lower-resolution modeled structures.
	Docking approaches have to deal with the conformational changes between
	unbound and bound structures, as well as the inaccuracies of the
	interacting modeled structures, often in a high-throughput mode needed
	for modeling of large networks of protein interactions. The growing
	number of docking developers is engaged in the community-wide assessments

	the final assembly in which most waters have been expelled from the

	26S proteasome, and the nuclear pore complex). A reliable high-resolution
	structural characterization of these assemblies is frequently beyond
	the reach of current experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography,
	NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, footprinting, chemical cross-linking,
	FRET spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and proteomics.
	However, the information garnered from different methods can be combined
	and used to build models of the assembly structures that are consistent
	with all of the available datasets, and therefore more accurate,
	precise, and complete. Here, we describe a protocol for this integration,
	whereby the information is converted to a set of spatial restraints
	and a variety of optimization procedures can be used to generate
	models that satisfy the restraints as well as possible. These generated
	models can then potentially inform about the precision and accuracy
	of structure determination, the accuracy of the input datasets, and
	further data generation. We also demonstrate the Integrative Modeling
	Platform (IMP) software, which provides the necessary computational
	framework to implement this protocol, and several applications for
	specific use cases.},

  abstract = {Targeting the interfaces between proteins has huge therapeutic potential,
	but discovering small-molecule drugs that disrupt protein-protein
	interactions is an enormous challenge. Several recent success stories,
	however, indicate that protein-protein interfaces might be more tractable
	than has been thought. These studies discovered small molecules that
	bind with drug-like potencies to 'hotspots' on the contact surfaces
	involved in protein-protein interactions. Remarkably, these small
	molecules bind deeper within the contact surface of the target protein,
	and bind with much higher efficiencies, than do the contact atoms
	of the natural protein partner. Some of these small molecules are
	now making their way through clinical trials, so this high-hanging
	fruit might not be far out of reach.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional structures of only a small fraction of known protein-protein
	complexes are currently known. Meanwhile, computational methods are
	of increasing importance to provide structural models for known protein-protein

	if experimentally determined partner proteins undergo little conformational
	changes upon binding. However, the realistic and computationally
	efficient treatment of conformational changes especially of the protein
	backbone during docking remains a challenge. New promising approaches
	of flexible refinement, ensemble docking and explicit inclusion of
	flexibility during the entire docking process have been developed.
	A significant fraction of known protein-protein interactions can
	be modeled based on homology to known protein-protein complexes which
	in many cases also requires efficient flexible refinement to provide
	accurate structural models.},
