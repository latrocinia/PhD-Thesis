In this work we have introduced PowerFit, an open source Python package, which
comes with a command line tool \powerfit\ to perform an exhaustive
cross-correlation based rigid body search. It implements a new core-weighted
enhanced LCC score that significantly expands the applicable fitting resolution
range. In addition, \powerfit\ minimizes the computational time requirements by
using optimized rotation/orientation sets, trimming and resampling the electron
density, and leveraging the computational resources provided by GPUs. PowerFit
is therefore a valuable addition to the structural biologist toolbox, allowing
obtaining an objective initial fit of high-resolution subunits in
low-resolution cryo-EM density maps within a reasonable time.
