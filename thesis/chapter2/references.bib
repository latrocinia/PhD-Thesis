	Here we present structures of Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens
	80S ribosomes in complex with the translation factor eEF2, E-site
	transfer RNA and Stm1-like proteins, based on high-resolution cryo-electron-microscopy
	density maps. These structures not only illustrate the co-evolution
	of metazoan-specific ribosomal RNA with ribosomal proteins but also
	reveal the presence of two additional structural layers in metazoan
	ribosomes, a well-ordered inner layer covered by a flexible RNA outer
	layer. The human and Drosophila ribosome structures will provide
	the basis for more detailed structural, biochemical and genetic experiments.},

	(15-30 A) is critical for image reconstructions from electron microscopy
	(EM). The new algorithm enables for the first time the reliable docking
	of smaller molecular components into EM densities of large biomolecular
	assemblies at such low resolutions. As an example of the practical
	effectiveness of contour-based fitting, a new pseudo-atomic model

  abstract = {The bacterial RsgA, a circularly permutated GTPase, whose GTPase activity
	is dependent on the 30S ribosomal subunit, is a late-stage ribosome
	biogenesis factor involved in the 30S subunit maturation. The role
	of RsgA is to release another 30S biogenesis factor, RbfA, from the
	mature 30S subunit in a GTP-dependent manner. Using cryoelectron
	microscopy, we have determined the structure of the 30S subunit bound
	with RsgA in the presence of GMPPNP at subnanometer resolution. In
	the structure, RsgA binds to the central part of the 30S subunit,
	close to the decoding center, in a position that is incompatible
	with multiple biogenesis factors, all three translation initiation
	factors, as well as A-, P-site tRNAs and the 50S subunit. Further
	structural analysis not only provides a structural model for the
	RsgA-dependent release of RbfA from the nascent 30S subunit, but
	also indicates RsgA's role in the ribosomal protein assembly, to
	promote some tertiary binding protein incorporation. Moreover, together
	with available biochemical and genetic data, our results suggest
	that RsgA might be a general checkpoint protein in the late stage
	of the 30S subunit biogenesis, whose function is not only to release
	biogenesis factors (e.g., RbfA) from the nascent 30S subunit, but
	also to block the association of initiation factors to the premature

	(FFT) EM density fitting program which can exploit the special hardware
	properties of modern graphics processor units (GPUs) to accelerate
	both the translational and rotational parts of the correlation search.
	In particular, by using the GPU's special texture memory hardware
	to rotate 3D voxel grids, the cost of rotating large 3D density maps
	is almost completely eliminated. Compared to performing 3D correlations
	on one core of a contemporary central processor unit (CPU), running
	gEMfitter on a modern GPU gives up to 26-fold speed-up. Furthermore,
	using our parallel processing framework, this speed-up increases
	linearly with the number of CPUs or GPUs used. Thus, it is now possible
	to use routinely more robust but more expensive 3D correlation techniques.
	When tested on low resolution experimental cryo-EM data for the GroEL-GroES
	complex, we demonstrate the satisfactory fitting results that may
	be achieved by using a locally normalised cross-correlation with

  abstract = {The design, implementation, and capabilities of an extensible visualization
	system, UCSF Chimera, are discussed. Chimera is segmented into a
	core that provides basic services and visualization, and extensions
	that provide most higher level functionality. This architecture ensures
	that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers
	who wish to incorporate new features. Two unusual extensions are
	presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale
	molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which
	allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite
	being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer,
	for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures;
	ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying
	molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and
	analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera
	in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future
	directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to
	academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows,
	Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.},

  abstract = {A versatile tool for selecting particles from electron micrographs,

	is presented. It is based on a local real-space correlation method.
	Real-space correlations calculated over a local area are suitable
	for finding small objects or patterns in a larger field. They provide
	a very sensitive measure-of-fit, partly due to local optimisation
	of the numerical scaling. It is equivalent to least squares with
	optimised scaling between the two objects being correlated. The only
	disadvantage of real-space methods is that they are slow to compute.
	A fast local correlation algorithm based on Fourier transforms has
	been developed, which is approximately two orders of magnitude faster
	than the explicit real-space formulation. The algorithm is demonstrated
	by application to the problem of locating images of macromolecules
	in transmission electron micrographs of unstained frozen hydrated
	specimens. This is a challenging computational problem because these
	images have low contrast and a low signal-to-noise ratio. Picking
	particles by hand is very time consuming and can be less accurate.
	The automated procedure gives a significant increase in speed, which
	is important if large numbers of particles have to be picked.},

  abstract = {Accurate maps of large macromolecular complexes can be calculated
	from cryo-electron micrographs of non-crystalline specimens to resolutions
	of about 10 A. A method to dock the atomic structures of domains
	solved by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance into
	cryo-EM maps is presented. Domains can be docked independently into
	large complexes without prior definition of the boundaries. No special
	symmetry is assumed and the procedure is suitable for general application
	to almost any system where a cryo-EM map (at 15 A resolution or better)
	of a complex has been obtained and the atomic structures of the components
	are available. This is achieved through use of a real-space density-matching
	procedure based on local correlation. A complete asymmetric unit
	search correlating a density object derived from the atomic coordinates
	and the density of the EM map is performed. The correlation coefficient
	is calculated locally in real space using only values of the search
	object and corresponding samples extracted from the EM map which
	are under the 'footprint' of the positioned search object. The procedure
	has been demonstrated by docking the domains of GroEL from the crystal
	structure into a cryo-EM map Fourier filtered to 12 or 15 A resolution.
	The correct positions were found without applying any additional
	constraints. A model of the oligomer built from the docked domains
	compared favourably with the known crystal structure, confirming
	the validity of the approach. The procedure is designed to facilitate
	the incorporation of additional constraints on the docking solutions,
	which could help to dock using lower resolution maps.},

  abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy of "single particles" is a powerful method
	to analyze structures of large macromolecular assemblies that are
	not amenable to investigation by traditional X-ray crystallographic
	methods. A key step in these studies is to obtain atomic interpretations
	of multiprotein complexes by fitting atomic structures of individual
	components into maps obtained from electron microscopic data. Here,
	we report the use of a "core-weighting" method, combined with a grid-threading
	Monte Carlo (GTMC) approach for this purpose. The "core" of an individual
	structure is defined to represent the part where the density distribution
	is least likely to be altered by other components that comprise the
	macromolecular assembly of interest. The performance of the method
	has been evaluated by its ability to determine the correct fit of
	(i) the alpha-chain of the T-cell receptor variable domain into a
	simulated map of the alphabeta complex at resolutions between 5 and
	40 A, and (ii) the E2 catalytic domain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
	into an experimentally determined map, at 14 A resolution, of the
	icosahedral complex formed by 60 copies of this enzyme. Using the
	X-ray structures of the two test cases as references, we demonstrate
	that, in contrast to more traditional methods, the combination of
	the core-weighting method and the grid-threading Monte Carlo approach
	can identify the correct fit reliably and rapidly from the low-resolution
