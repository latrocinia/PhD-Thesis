{(A) Simulated 15\Angstrom\ cryo-EM data of the 7CEI complex. 
(B) The density with centroids (grey spheres) representing the approximate
center of mass (COM) of each subunit. 
(C) Initial docking setup in HADDOCK. Distance restraints are defined between
the COM of chain A (light-grey) and B (dark-grey) of 7CEI and their
corresponding centroids. 
(D) An initial complex is formed after a rigid body energy minimization (EM). 
(E) The position of the subunits is approximately correct, but their
orientation in the cryo-EM map should still be determined. 
(F) A fine rotational search is performed around the axis that is formed by the
line joining the two centroids. 
The orientation with the highest cross correlation value is chosen. 
(G) A final rigid body EM is performed now directly against the cryo-EM data
using a cross correlation-based potential without the centroid-based distance
restraints.}

\caption{Quality and number of generated acceptable models after rigid-body
docking (it0).}
{(A) Interface RMSD (i-RMSD) of the best model generated after the it0-stage
for the 17 complexes of the benchmark. White bar: HADDOCK-CM (ab initio docking
mode with center-of-mass restraints); Light-grey, grey and dark-grey bar:
HADDOCK-EM using 20, 15 and 10\Angstrom\ simulated cryo-EM data, respectively; Black
bar: minimal i-RMSD of unbound compared to bound complex. The complexes are
ordered according to their difficulty level. The dashed line represents the
cutoff for an accetable solution (i-RMSD ≤ 4\Angstrom).
(B) Number of acceptable solutions in the 10000 generated models after the
it0-stage (bar height) and number of acceptable solutions in the 400 best
scoring models (inner solid bar). Only complexes for which acceptable solutions
were generated are displayed. Light-grey: HADDOCK-CM; Grey, dark-grey and black

{The i-RMSD improvement (i-RMSD it0 – i-RMSD itw) for all refined complexes
after itw when using 10 (A), 15 (B), and 20\Angstrom\ (C) data plotted as a histogram. 
Positive values indicate a decrease in i-RMSD toward the native structure. The

\caption{HADDOCK-EM with symmetry protocol applied on the trypsin inhibitor and
large terminase pentamer.}
{(A) Protocol of HADDOCK-EM with symmetry during the rigid body stage. After
determining the centroids in the density, each subunit is placed on a circle
concentric with the centroids' midpoint. C5-symmetry is imposed on the
system from the beginning and ambiguous distance restraints are generated
between the center of mass of each subunit and each centroid. An initial complex is formed
by rigid body energy minimization (EM). To orient the complex properly in the
density, we calculate the cross correlation of two orientations of the complex
with the cryo-EM data. A second round of rigid body EM is performed on the
orientation with the highest cross correlation directly against the cryo-EM
data. 
(B) The HADDOCK-EM score versus the interface-RMSD compared to the native complex
(1B0C) are plotted for the 400 refinement complexes using 20, 15 and 10\Angstrom\
simulated data.}
