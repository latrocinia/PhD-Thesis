  abstract = {To understand the cell, we need to determine the macromolecular assembly
	structures, which may consist of tens to hundreds of components.
	First, we review the varied experimental data that characterize the
	assemblies at several levels of resolution. We then describe computational
	methods for generating the structures using these data. To maximize
	completeness, resolution, accuracy, precision, and efficiency of
	the structure determination, a computational approach is required
	that uses spatial information from a variety of experimental methods.
	We propose such an approach, defined by its three main components:
	a hierarchical representation of the assembly, a scoring function
	consisting of spatial restraints derived from experimental data,
	and an optimization method that generates structures consistent with
	the data. This approach is illustrated by determining the configuration
	of the 456 proteins in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) from baker's
	yeast. With these tools, we are poised to integrate structural information
	gathered at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy--from atoms
	to cells--into a common framework.},

  abstract = {An atomic scale interpretation facilitates the assignment of functional
	properties to 3D reconstructions of macromolecular assemblies in
	electron microscopy (EM). Such a high-resolution interpretation is
	typically achieved by docking the known atomic structures of components
	into the volumetric EM maps. Docking locations are often determined
	by maximizing the cross-correlation coefficient of the two objects
	in a slow, exhaustive search. If time is of essence, such as in related
	visualization and image processing fields, the matching of data is
	accelerated by incorporating feature points that form a compact description
	of 3D objects. The complexity reduction afforded by the feature point
	representation enables a near-instantaneous matching. We show that
	such reduced matching can also deliver robust and accurate results
	in the presence of noise or artifacts. We therefore propose a novel
	multi-resolution registration technique employing feature-based shape
	descriptions of the volumetric and structural data. The pattern-matching
	algorithm carries out a hierarchical alignment of the point sets
	generated by vector quantization. The search-space complexity is
	reduced by an integrated tree-pruning technique, which permits the
	detection of subunits in large macromolecular assemblies in real-time.
	The efficiency and accuracy of the novel algorithm are validated
	on a standard test system of homo-oligomeric assemblies.},

	reveals that KsgA binds to the 30S platform with the catalytic N-terminal
	domain interacting with substrate adenosine residues in helix 45
	and the C-terminal domain making extensive contacts to helix 27 and
	helix 24. KsgA excludes the penultimate rRNA helix 44 from adopting
	its position in the mature 30S subunit, blocking the formation of

  abstract = {A novel contour-based matching criterion is presented for the quantitative
	docking of high-resolution structures of components into low-resolution
	maps of macromolecular complexes. The proposed Laplacian filter is
	combined with a six-dimensional search using fast Fourier transforms
	to rapidly scan the rigid-body degrees of freedom of a probe molecule

	performance with the standard cross-correlation criterion demonstrates
	that contour matching with the Laplacian filter significantly extends
	the viable resolution range of correlation-based fitting to resolutions
	as low as 30 A. The gain in docking precision at medium to low resolution
	(15-30 A) is critical for image reconstructions from electron microscopy
	(EM). The new algorithm enables for the first time the reliable docking
	of smaller molecular components into EM densities of large biomolecular
	assemblies at such low resolutions. As an example of the practical
	effectiveness of contour-based fitting, a new pseudo-atomic model

	The terminase is a powerful motor that converts ATP hydrolysis into

	of the T7 large terminase by electron microscopy. The five terminase
	subunits assemble in a toroid that encloses a channel wide enough
	to accommodate dsDNA. The structure of the complete connector-terminase
	complex is also reported, revealing the coupling between the terminase
	and the connector forming a continuous channel. The structure of
	the terminase assembled into the complex showed a different conformation
	when compared with the isolated terminase pentamer. To understand
	in molecular terms the terminase morphological change, we generated
	the terminase atomic model based on the crystallographic structure
	of its phage T4 counterpart. The docking of the threaded model in
	both terminase conformations showed that the transition between the
	two states can be achieved by rigid body subunit rotation in the
	pentameric assembly. The existence of two terminase conformations

	web server in the CAPRI experiment and discuss the strengths and
	weaknesses of data-driven docking. HADDOCK was successful for 6 out
	of 9 complexes (6 out of 11 targets) and accurately predicted the
	individual interfaces for two more complexes. The HADDOCK server,
	which is the first allowing the simultaneous docking of generic multi-body
	complexes, was successful in 4 out of 7 complexes for which it participated.
	In the scoring experiment, we predicted the highest number of targets
	of any group. The main weakness of data-driven docking revealed from
	these last CAPRI results is its vulnerability for incorrect experimental
	data related to the interface or the stoichiometry of the complex.
	At the same time, the use of experimental and/or predicted information
	is also the strength of our approach as evidenced for those targets
	for which accurate experimental information was available (e.g.,
	the 10 three-stars predictions for T40!). Even when the models show
	a wrong orientation, the individual interfaces are generally well
	predicted with an average coverage of 60\% ± 26\% over all targets.

	An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown
	to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is
	demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes,
	for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been
	solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were

	The method named EMLZerD generates a pool of candidate multiple protein

	ones that fit well into the EM map. The comparison of docking conformations

	a mathematical series expansion of three-dimensional functions. The
	3DZD provides a unified representation of the surface shape of multimeric
	protein complex models and EM maps, which allows a convenient, fast
	quantitative comparison of the three-dimensional structural data.
	Out of 19 multimeric complexes tested, near native complex structures

	is dependent on the 30S ribosomal subunit, is a late-stage ribosome
	biogenesis factor involved in the 30S subunit maturation. The role
	of RsgA is to release another 30S biogenesis factor, RbfA, from the
	mature 30S subunit in a GTP-dependent manner. Using cryoelectron
	microscopy, we have determined the structure of the 30S subunit bound
	with RsgA in the presence of GMPPNP at subnanometer resolution. In
	the structure, RsgA binds to the central part of the 30S subunit,
	close to the decoding center, in a position that is incompatible
	with multiple biogenesis factors, all three translation initiation
	factors, as well as A-, P-site tRNAs and the 50S subunit. Further
	structural analysis not only provides a structural model for the
	RsgA-dependent release of RbfA from the nascent 30S subunit, but
	also indicates RsgA's role in the ribosomal protein assembly, to
	promote some tertiary binding protein incorporation. Moreover, together
	with available biochemical and genetic data, our results suggest
	that RsgA might be a general checkpoint protein in the late stage
	of the 30S subunit biogenesis, whose function is not only to release
	biogenesis factors (e.g., RbfA) from the nascent 30S subunit, but
	also to block the association of initiation factors to the premature
	30S subunit.},

	microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps is an important technique for modeling

	(FFT) EM density fitting program which can exploit the special hardware
	properties of modern graphics processor units (GPUs) to accelerate
	both the translational and rotational parts of the correlation search.
	In particular, by using the GPU's special texture memory hardware
	to rotate 3D voxel grids, the cost of rotating large 3D density maps
	is almost completely eliminated. Compared to performing 3D correlations
	on one core of a contemporary central processor unit (CPU), running
	gEMfitter on a modern GPU gives up to 26-fold speed-up. Furthermore,
	using our parallel processing framework, this speed-up increases
	linearly with the number of CPUs or GPUs used. Thus, it is now possible
	to use routinely more robust but more expensive 3D correlation techniques.
	When tested on low resolution experimental cryo-EM data for the GroEL-GroES
	complex, we demonstrate the satisfactory fitting results that may
	be achieved by using a locally normalised cross-correlation with
	a Laplacian pre-filter, while still being up to three orders of magnitude

	both within the p53 tetramer and with a multitude of regulatory proteins.

  abstract = {Over the last years, large scale proteomics studies have generated
	a wealth of information of biomolecular complexes. Adding the structural
	dimension to the resulting interactomes represents a major challenge
	that classical structural experimental methods alone will have difficulties
	to confront. To meet this challenge, complementary modeling techniques
	such as docking are thus needed. Among the current docking methods,
	HADDOCK (High Ambiguity-Driven DOCKing) distinguishes itself from
	others by the use of experimental and/or bioinformatics data to drive
	the modeling process and has shown a strong performance in the critical
	assessment of prediction of interactions (CAPRI), a blind experiment
	for the prediction of interactions. Although most docking programs
	are limited to binary complexes, HADDOCK can deal with multiple molecules
	(up to six), a capability that will be required to build large macromolecular
	assemblies. We present here a novel web interface of HADDOCK that
	allows the user to dock up to six biomolecules simultaneously. This
	interface allows the inclusion of a large variety of both experimental
	and/or bioinformatics data and supports several types of cyclic and
	dihedral symmetries in the docking of multibody assemblies. The server
	was tested on a benchmark of six cases, containing five symmetric
	homo-oligomeric protein complexes and one symmetric protein-DNA complex.
	Our results reveal that, in the presence of either bioinformatics
	and/or experimental data, HADDOCK shows an excellent performance:
	in all cases, HADDOCK was able to generate good to high quality solutions
	and ranked them at the top, demonstrating its ability to model symmetric
	multicomponent assemblies. Docking methods can thus play an important
	role in adding the structural dimension to interactomes. However,
	although the current docking methodologies were successful for a
	vast range of cases, considering the variety and complexity of macromolecular
	assemblies, inclusion of some kind of experimental information (e.g.
	from mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryoelectron
	microscopy, etc.) will remain highly desirable to obtain reliable

  abstract = {Recently, electron microscopy measurement of single particles has
	enabled us to reconstruct a low-resolution 3D density map of large
	biomolecular complexes. If structures of the complex subunits can
	be solved by x-ray crystallography at atomic resolution, fitting
	these models into the 3D density map can generate an atomic resolution
	model of the entire large complex. The fitting of multiple subunits,
	however, generally requires large computational costs; therefore,
	development of an efficient algorithm is required. We developed a
	fast fitting program, "gmfit", which employs a Gaussian mixture model
	(GMM) to represent approximated shapes of the 3D density map and
	the atomic models. A GMM is a distribution function composed by adding
	together several 3D Gaussian density functions. Because our model
	analytically provides an integral of a product of two distribution
	functions, it enables us to quickly calculate the fitness of the
	density map and the atomic models. Using the integral, two types
	of potential energy function are introduced: the attraction potential
	energy between a 3D density map and each subunit, and the repulsion
	potential energy between subunits. The restraint energy for symmetry
	is also employed to build symmetrical origomeric complexes. To find
	the optimal configuration of subunits, we randomly generated initial
	configurations of subunit models, and performed a steepest-descent
	method using forces and torques of the three potential energies.
	Comparison between an original density map and its GMM showed that
	the required number of Gaussian distribution functions for a given
	accuracy depended on both resolution and molecular size. We then
	performed test fitting calculations for simulated low-resolution
	density maps of atomic models of homodimer, trimer, and hexamer,
	using different search parameters. The results indicated that our
	method was able to rebuild atomic models of a complex even for maps
	of 30 A resolution if sufficient numbers (eight or more) of Gaussian
	distribution functions were employed for each subunit, and the symmetric
	restraints were assigned for complexes with more than three subunits.
	As a more realistic test, we tried to build an atomic model of the
	GroEL/ES complex by fitting 21-subunit atomic models into the 3D
	density map obtained by cryoelectron microscopy using the C7 symmetric
	restraints. A model with low root mean-square deviations (14.7 A)
	was obtained as the lowest-energy model, showing that our fitting
	method was reasonably accurate. Inclusion of other restraints from
	biological and biochemical experiments could further enhance the
	accuracy.},

	The initial placement of the subunits is done visually or with the

	The protocol minimizes the quadratic misfit by sequential refinement
	of the subunits, so one unit is allowed to move while the others

	to my insight now. 
	
	
	
	The package is called URO.
	
	
	Probably not so usefull in itself since it is not fully automatic,

	interesting leads for protein drug design. In recent years, large-scale

	the paucity of data regarding their molecular binding mechanisms

	(extended, a-helix, polyproline-II), flexible docking with HADDOCK
	generates 79.4\% of high quality models for bound/unbound and 69.4\%
	for unbound/unbound docking when tested against the largest protein-peptide

	at the rigid-body docking stage successfully recovers the most relevant
	conformation for a given protein-peptide complex and the subsequent
	flexible refinement further improves the interface by up to 4.5 Å
	interface RMSD. Cluster-based scoring of the models results in a
	selection of near-native solutions in the top three for ∼75\% of
	the successfully predicted cases. This unified conformational selection

  abstract = {The 2H2 monoclonal antibody recognizes the precursor peptide on immature
	dengue virus and might therefore be a useful tool for investigating
	the conformational change that occurs when the immature virus enters
	an acidic environment. During dengue virus maturation, spiky, immature,
	noninfectious virions change their structure to form smooth-surfaced
	particles in the slightly acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network,
	thereby allowing cellular furin to cleave the precursor-membrane
	proteins. The dengue virions become fully infectious when they release
	the cleaved precursor peptide upon reaching the neutral-pH environment
	of the extracellular space. Here we report on the cryo-electron microscopy
	structures of the immature virus complexed with the 2H2 antigen binding
	fragments (Fab) at different concentrations and under various pH
	conditions. At neutral pH and a high concentration of Fab molecules,
	three Fab molecules bind to three precursor-membrane proteins on
	each spike of the immature virus. However, at a low concentration
	of Fab molecules and pH 7.0, only two Fab molecules bind to each
	spike. Changing to a slightly acidic pH caused no detectable change
	of structure for the sample with a high Fab concentration but caused
	severe structural damage to the low-concentration sample. Therefore,
	the 2H2 Fab inhibits the maturation process of immature dengue virus
	when Fab molecules are present at a high concentration, because the
	three Fab molecules on each spike hold the precursor-membrane molecules
	together, thereby inhibiting the normal conformational change that
	occurs during maturation.},

  abstract = {Single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) typically produces
	density maps of macromolecular assemblies at intermediate to low
	resolution (approximately 5-30 A). By fitting high-resolution structures
	of assembly components into these maps, pseudo-atomic models can
	be obtained. Optimizing the quality-of-fit of all components simultaneously
	is challenging due to the large search space that makes the exhaustive
	search over all possible component configurations computationally
	unfeasible.We developed an efficient mathematical programming algorithm
	that simultaneously fits all component structures into an assembly
	density map. The fitting is formulated as a point set matching problem
	involving several point sets that represent component and assembly
	densities at a reduced complexity level. In contrast to other point
	matching algorithms, our algorithm is able to match multiple point
	sets simultaneously and not only based on their geometrical equivalence,
	but also based on the similarity of the density in the immediate
	point neighborhood. In addition, we present an efficient refinement
	method based on the Iterative Closest Point registration algorithm.
	The integer quadratic programming method generates an assembly configuration
	in a few seconds. This efficiency allows the generation of an ensemble
	of candidate solutions that can be assessed by an independent scoring
	function. We benchmarked the method using simulated density maps
	of 11 protein assemblies at 20 A, and an experimental cryoEM map
	at 23.5 A resolution. Our method was able to generate assembly structures
	with root-mean-square errors <6.5 A, which have been further reduced
	to <1.8 A by the local refinement procedure.The program is available
	upon request as a Matlab code package.Supplementary data are available
