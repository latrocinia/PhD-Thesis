\Section{Conclusion}

We have fully integrated cryo-EM data into HADDOCK, allowing the direct
combination of cryo-EM data with all other available sources of information
that HADDOCK supports, including symmetry and ambiguous interaction restraints.
The performance of this integrative docking protocol was demonstrated using
simulated cryo-EM data for a benchmark of 17 non-redundant protein-protein
complexes: Including the cryo-EM data into the docking significantly increases
both the quality and quantity of acceptable solutions, with higher resolution
data having a larger impact.  Its applicability was demonstrated on two
ribosome, two virus-antibody and a symmetrical case using experimental data
ranging from 8.5 to 21Ã….  The integration of cryo-EM data with a proper
physics-based force field and all other available information sources provides
a powerful and user-friendly tool to generate high quality, high resolution
models of macromolecular assemblies.
