\Section{Examples}

To illustrate the capabilities of \disvis, we applied it on two systems, using
MS cross-links data. A fine rotational search (5.27\Deg, 53256 orientations)
was performed using default values. First we investigated the accessible
interaction space of two chains of the RNA polymerase II complex of S.
cerevisiae (1WCM, chain A and E) for which 6 BS3 cross-links were available
(\instable[tab:RPII-crosslinks]) \cite[Chen2010, Kahraman2013]. The allowed distance was set between 0 and
30\Angstrom\ (\Cbeta -- \Cbeta) for every restraint. Two false-positive
restraints were added with a distance in the crystal structure of 35.7 (FP1)
and 42.2\Angstrom\ (FP2) to test whether these violating restraintsthey could be
identified. Applying disvis shows that none of the \m{18.9 \times 10^9}
complexes sampled are consistent with all 8 restraints, though a small number
are conforming to 7 cross-links (9716 complexes)
(\instable[tab:RPII-accessible-complexes-fine]). For the latter, only restraint
FP2 is violated. The accessible interaction space consistent with at least 6
restraints is less than 0.03\percent\ of the full interaction space
(\infigure[fig:RNA-polymerase-II]).  The density clearly indicates the position
of the E-chain. Interestingly, both false-positive restraints are violated in
100\percent\ of the complexes consistent with at least 6 restraints; in
contrast, the highest violation percentage of a correct cross-link is only
0.1\percent (\instable[tab:RPII-violations-fine]). Thus, a high-violation
percentage is an indication of a false-positive restraint.

Secondly, we applied disvis on two proteins of the 26S proteasome of S. pombe,
PRE5 and PUP2, with 7 cross-links available
(\instable[tab:PRE5-PUP2-crosslinks]) \cite[Leitner2014]. The acceptable
distances for the ADH and ZL cross-links were set to 23 and 26\Angstrom\
(\Calpha -- \Calpha), respectively, as 95\percent\ of distances found in a
benchmark were shorter \cite[Leitner2014]. The PRE5-PUP2 complex is
significantly smaller than the previous example with the full interaction space
consisting of \m{6.9 \times 10^9} complexes. Still, the accessible interaction
space consistent with all 7 restraints is heavily reduced to less than
0.04\percent\ of the full interaction space. The accessible interaction space
of the PUP2 chain with respect to PRE5 is overlapping with its center of mass
deduced from a homology model (\infigure[fig:PRE5-PUP2]). 

The computation for those two examples took 74m and 27m on 16 AMD Opteron 6344
processors and 76m and 19m on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 GPU, respectively.
However, by increasing the voxel spacing to 2\Angstrom\ and using a coarser
rotational search (9.72\Deg, 7416 orientations) rather similar results can be
obtained in only 19m and 8m, respectively, on a single processor (cf.
\instable[tab:RPII-accessible-complexes-fine] and
\ins[tab:RPII-accessible-complexes-coarse] for example). It should further be
noted that the bulk of the time is spent on computing the FFTs and a negligible
part on computing the consistent distance restraint space
(\instable[tab:profiling-disvis]).
