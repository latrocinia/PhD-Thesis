  abstract = {Higher-order multi-protein complexes such as RNA polymerase II (Pol
	II) complexes with transcription initiation factors are often not
	amenable to X-ray structure determination. Here, we show that protein
	cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) has now sufficiently
	advanced as a tool to extend the Pol II structure to a 15-subunit,
	670 kDa complex of Pol II with the initiation factor TFIIF at peptide
	resolution. The N-terminal regions of TFIIF subunits Tfg1 and Tfg2
	form a dimerization domain that binds the Pol II lobe on the Rpb2
	side of the active centre cleft near downstream DNA. The C-terminal
	winged helix (WH) domains of Tfg1 and Tfg2 are mobile, but the Tfg2
	WH domain can reside at the Pol II protrusion near the predicted
	path of upstream DNA in the initiation complex. The linkers between
	the dimerization domain and the WH domains in Tfg1 and Tfg2 are located
	to the jaws and protrusion, respectively. The results suggest how
	TFIIF suppresses non-specific DNA binding and how it helps to recruit
	promoter DNA and to set the transcription start site. This work establishes
	cross-linking/MS as an integrated structure analysis tool for large
	multi-protein complexes.},

	of more abundant native peptides. To facilitate the search and identification
	of cross-linked peptides, we have developed a novel software suite,

	involved in analyzing protein cross-linking experiments when combined

	cross-links using three-dimensional models, which is particularly
	useful when combining chemical cross-linking with other structural

	distance restraints generated by chemical cross-linking and mass
	spectrometry into ROSETTA protocols for comparative and de novo modeling
	and protein-protein docking. We demonstrate that the cross-link validation
	and visualization software Xwalk facilitates successful cross-link

	of chemical cross-links from 14 different publications with 506 intra-protein
	and 62 inter-protein cross-links, where each cross-link can be mapped
	on an experimental structure from the Protein Data Bank. Finally,
	we demonstrate on a protein-protein docking reference data set the
	impact of virtual cross-links on protein docking calculations and
	show that an inter-protein cross-link can reduce on average the RMSD
	of a docking prediction by 5.0 Å. The methods and results presented

  abstract = {A geometric recognition algorithm was developed to identify molecular

	(i) a digital representation of the molecules (derived from atomic
	coordinates) by three-dimensional discrete functions that distinguishes
	between the surface and the interior; (ii) the calculation, using
	Fourier transformation, of a correlation function that assesses the
	degree of molecular surface overlap and penetration upon relative
	shifts of the molecules in three dimensions; and (iii) a scan of
	the relative orientations of the molecules in three dimensions. The
	algorithm provides a list of correlation values indicating the extent
	of geometric match between the surfaces of the molecules; each of
	these values is associated with six numbers describing the relative
	position (translation and rotation) of the molecules. The procedure
	is thus equivalent to a six-dimensional search but much faster by
	design, and the computation time is only moderately dependent on
	molecular size. The procedure was tested and validated by using five
	known complexes for which the correct relative position of the molecules
	in the respective adducts was successfully predicted. The molecular
	pairs were deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, tRNA synthetase-tyrosinyl
	adenylate, aspartic proteinase-peptide inhibitor, and trypsin-trypsin

	pairs by using the structures of uncomplexed aspartic proteinase

	One such experimental method is chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry
	(XL-MS), in which protein complexes are crosslinked and characterized
	using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to pinpoint specific
	amino acid residues in close structural proximity. The commonly used
	lysine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester reagents disuccinimidylsuberate
	(DSS) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS(3) ) have a linker arm
	that is 11.4 Å long when fully extended, allowing Cα (alpha carbon
	of protein backbone) atoms of crosslinked lysine residues to be up
	to ∼24 Å apart. However, XL-MS studies on proteins of known structure
	frequently report crosslinks that exceed this distance. Typically,
	a tolerance of ∼3 Å is added to the theoretical maximum to account
	for this observation, with limited justification for the chosen value.
	We used the Dynameomics database, a repository of high-quality molecular
	dynamics simulations of 807 proteins representative of diverse protein
	folds, to investigate the relationship between lysine-lysine distances
	in experimental starting structures and in simulation ensembles.
	We conclude that for DSS/BS(3), a distance constraint of 26-30 Å
	between Cα atoms is appropriate. This analysis provides a theoretical
	basis for the widespread practice of adding a tolerance to the crosslinker
	length when comparing XL-MS results to structures or in modeling.
	We also discuss the comparison of XL-MS results to MD simulations
	and known structures as a means to test and validate experimental

  abstract = {After more than a decade of method development, cross-linking in combination
	with mass spectrometry and bioinformatics is finally coming of age.
	This technology now provides improved opportunities for modelling
	by mapping structural details of functional complexes in solution.
	The structure of proteins or protein complexes is ascertained by
	identifying amino acid pairs that are positioned in close proximity
	to each other. The validity of this technique has recently been benchmarked
	for large multi-protein complexes, by comparing cross-link data with
	that from a crystal structure of RNA polymerase II. Here, the specific
	nature of this cross-linking data will be discussed to assess the
	technical challenges and opportunities for model building. We believe
	that once remaining technological challenges of cross-linking/mass
	spectrometry have been addressed and cross-linking/mass spectrometry
	data has been incorporated into modelling algorithms it will quickly
	become an indispensable companion of protein and protein complex
	modelling and a corner-stone of integrated structural biology.},

  abstract = {Protein interactions define the homeostatic state of the cell. Our
	ability to understand these interactions and their role in both health
	and disease is tied to our knowledge of the 3D atomic structure of
	the interacting partners and their complexes. Despite advances in
	experimental method of structure determination, the majority of known
	protein interactions are still missing an atomic structure. High-resolution
	methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy struggle
	with the high-throughput demand, while low-resolution techniques
	such as cryo-electron microscopy or small-angle X-ray scattering
	provide data that are too coarse. Computational structure prediction
	of protein complexes, or docking, was first developed to complement
	experimental research and has since blossomed into an independent
	and lively field of research. Its most successful products are hybrid
	approaches that combine powerful algorithms with experimental data
	from various sources to generate high-resolution models of protein
	complexes. This minireview introduces the concept of docking and
	docking with the help of experimental data, compares and contrasts
	the available integrative docking methods, and provides a guide for
	the experimental researcher for what types of data and which particular
	software can be used to model a protein complex.},

  abstract = {Most structure prediction algorithms consist of initial sampling of
	the conformational space, followed by rescoring and possibly refinement
	of a number of selected structures. Here we focus on protein docking,
	and show that while decoupling sampling and scoring facilitates method
	development, integration of the two steps can lead to substantial
	improvements in docking results. Since decoupling is usually achieved
	by generating a decoy set containing both non-native and near-native
	docked structures, which can be then used for scoring function construction,
	we first review the roles and potential pitfalls of decoys in protein-protein
	docking, and show that some type of decoys are better than others
	for method development. We then describe three case studies showing
	that complete decoupling of scoring from sampling is not the best
	choice for solving realistic docking problems. Although some of the
	examples are based on our own experience, the results of the CAPRI
	docking and scoring experiments also show that performing both sampling
	and scoring generally yields better results than scoring the structures
	generated by all predictors. Next we investigate how the selection
	of training and decoy sets affects the performance of the scoring
	functions obtained. Finally, we discuss pathways to better alignment
	of the two steps, and show some algorithms that achieve a certain
	level of integration. Although we focus on protein-protein docking,
	our observations most likely also apply to other conformational search
	problems, including protein structure prediction and the docking
	of small molecules to proteins.},
