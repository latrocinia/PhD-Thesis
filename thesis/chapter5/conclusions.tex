We have introduced DisVis, a Python package and command line tool to quantify
and visualize the information content of distance restraints, and a powerful
aid in detecting the presence of false-positive restraints. Our novel approach
can be easily incorporated in FFT-accelerated docking programs, allowing the
use of any form of distance-dependent energy function.
