{(A) The large subunit (purple) and the 27kDa polypeptide (yellow) of
the RNA polymerase II complex. (B) The large subunit and the reduced accessible
interaction space of the 27kDa polypeptide consistent with at least 6
cross-links in grey.  The smooth yellow sphere represents the center of mass of
the polypeptide.}

{(A) The PRE5 (red) complexed with PUP2 (green), based on a homology model.
(B) PRE5 and the accessible interaction space of PUP2 consistent with all 7
distance restraints (grey). The smooth red sphere represents the center of mass
of PUP2.}
