\caption{Accessible interaction space of two chains of the RNA polymerase II complex.}
{(A) The large subunit (purple) and the 27kDa polypeptide (yellow) . (B) The
large subunit and the reduced accessible interaction space of the 27kDa
polypeptide consistent with at least 6 cross-links in grey. The smooth yellow
sphere represents the center of mass of the polypeptide.}

\caption{Accessible interaction space of the PRE5-PUP2 complex.}
{(A) The PRE5 (red) complexed with PUP2 (green), based on a homology model.
(B) PRE5 and the accessible interaction space of PUP2 consistent with all 7
distance restraints (grey). The smooth red sphere represents the center of mass
of PUP2.}
